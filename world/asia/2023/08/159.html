   <p>SEOUL, South Korea – Japan will begin  over a million metric tons of treated radioactive water from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean on Thursday, over the objections of local fishermen, and the government of neighboring China.</p>   <p>Prime Minister Fumio Kishida made the announcement after meeting with his cabinet. The plan to release the water was formulated two years ago. Water will be released through an underground tunnel beginning Thursday, weather conditions permitting, Kishida said.</p>   <p>He  that the government has done everything it to ensure public safety, maintain transparency regarding the release, and protect the reputation of local fisheries. </p>    to remove radioactive material, with the exception of tritium, which has been diluted to one fortieth of Japan's safety standards. The International Atomic Energy Agency says the government's plan meets global safety standards.</p>   <p>On Monday, Kishida met with representatives of local , in a last-ditch bid to win their approval. The representatives continue to oppose the plan, and argue that, regardless of the science, consumers will not buy their catch. </p>   <p>Japan is also wary of allowing the water release issue to undermine a fragile rapprochement under way with neighboring South Korea. </p>   <p> The South Korean government has  of Japan's plan, but opposition politicians say they will file a  with the United Nations Human Rights Council, because they claim the release violates Japan's international agreements. Some South Korean consumers are already  Japanese seafood. </p>


      <h5 class="hdr">Correction Aug. 22, 2023</h5>
   <p><p>A previous version of this story incorrectly said water was used to heat nuclear fuel rods at the Fukushima plant. The water was used to cool them. </p></p>
