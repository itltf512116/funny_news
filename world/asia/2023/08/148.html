   <p>WASHINGTON — In a sign of growing strains between the world's two biggest powers, President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday that would block and regulate high-tech U.S.-based investments going toward China. It covers advanced computer chips, micro electronics, quantum information technologies and artificial intelligence.</p>   <p>Senior administration officials said that the effort stemmed from national security goals, rather than economic interests and that the categories it covered were narrow in scope. The order seeks to blunt China's ability to use U.S. investments in its technology companies to upgrade its military while also preserving broader levels of trade that are vital for both nations' economies.</p>            
                        <h3 class="slug"></h3>

   <p>Biden has suggested that China's economy is struggling and its global ambitions have been tempered as the U.S. has reenergized its alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia and the European Union. The administration consulted with allies and industry in shaping the executive order.</p>   <p>"Worry about China, but don't worry about China," Biden told donors at a June fundraising event in California.</p>   <p>The officials previewing the order said that China has exploited U.S. investments to support the development of weapons and modernize its military. The new limits would complement the export controls on advanced computer chips that were announced last year. The Treasury Department, which would monitor the investments, will announce a proposed rulemaking with definitions that would conform to the presidential order and go through a public comment process.</p>            
                        <h3 class="slug"></h3>

   <p>Yet reaction to Biden's order on Wednesday showed a desire to push harder on China. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said the order was an "essential step forward," but it "cannot be the final step." Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Biden should been more aggressive, saying, "we have to stop all U.S. investment in China's critical technology and military companies — period."</p>   <p>Biden has called Chinese President Xi Jinping a "dictator" in the aftermath of the U.S. shooting down a spy balloon from China that floated over the United States. Taiwan's status has been a source of tension, with Biden saying that China had become coercive regarding its independence.</p>   <p>China has supported Russia after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, though Biden has noted that the friendship has not extended to the shipment of weapons.</p>   <p>U.S. officials have long signaled the coming executive order on investing in China, but it's unclear whether financial markets will regard it as a tapered step or a continued escalation of tensions at a fragile moment.</p>   
            
                           
                        <h3 class="slug"></h3>

   <p>"The message it sends to the market may be far more decisive," said Elaine Dezenski, a senior director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "U.S. and multinational companies are already reexamining the risks of investing in China. Beijing's so-called 'national security' and 'anti-espionage' laws that curb routine and necessary corporate due diligence and compliance were already having a chilling effect on U.S. foreign direct investment. That chilling now risks turning into a deep freeze."</p>   <p>China's strong economic growth has stumbled coming out of pandemic lockdowns. On Wednesday, its National Bureau of Statistics reported a 0.3% decline in consumer prices in July from a year ago. That level of deflation points to a lack of consumer demand in China that could hamper growth.</p>            
                        <h3 class="slug"></h3>

   <p>Most foreign investment is believed to be brought in by Chinese companies and disguised as foreign money to get tax breaks and other benefits, according to Chinese researchers.</p>   <p>However, foreign business groups say global companies also are shifting investment plans to other economies.</p>   <p>Foreign companies have lost confidence in China following tighter security controls and a lack of action on reform promises. Calls by President Xi and other leaders for more economic self-reliance have left investors uneasy about their future in the state-dominated economy.</p>
