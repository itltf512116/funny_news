   <p>This year, as global travel has picked up in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, Chinese authorities are cutting off nearly all pathways abroad for Muslim believers, citing concerns that they may be radicalized abroad or encourage religious fervor once they return to China.</p>   <p>Public security officers were dispatched to domestic airports to screen outbound travelers headed to Islamic countries and tasked with phoning up and coercing pilgrims already abroad to turn back and go home, according to interviews with a dozen Chinese Muslims. Those found to have privately made the Hajj outside of state-authorized tours  upon returning to China.</p>   <p>"China wants to control you even when you are outside the country," one of the pilgrims said.</p>

   <h3 class="edTag">Getting a passport is the first challenge</h3>   <p>The first challenge for prospective Hajj-goers is obtaining travel documents. China  issuing new passports during the coronavirus pandemic, but in practice, restrictions remain especially tough for the country's estimated 20 million to 30 million Muslims, about 1.5-2% of the total population.</p>   <p>In the northwestern Chinese province of Qinghai, where the pilgrims live, authorities have stopped issuing new passports altogether to residents who are Uyghur or Hui, another primarily Muslim ethnic group, according to seven Muslim residents there.</p>    passports from ethnic Uyghur citizens in 2016, the year before authorities initiated a massive detention campaign targeting largely Uyghur communities.</p>   <p>The Qinghai passport restrictions began when the former party secretary of Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region,  to be a senior party official in Qinghai.</p>   <p>This year, in Qinghai province, those did get passports had to sign official letters promising that while traveling abroad they would not complete the Hajj, according to three Chinese Muslims who each signed such letters. A fourth Chinese Muslim said they also had to produce a school enrollment letter and bank statements showing they were traveling abroad for education, not to complete the Hajj.</p>   <p>The six pilgrims NPR kept in touch with were lucky; they managed to secure their travel documents three years earlier by applying through a passport office several hundred miles from Qinghai province.</p>

However, in the run-up to this year's pilgrimage, Chinese authorities were arresting private tour leaders.</p>   <p>One of those arrested was a tour leader named Ma Yanhu, who also writes online essays on scripture and Chinese religious policy under the pen name Tianfang. Originally trained as an Islamic theologian, Ma has led private Hajj tour groups for hundreds of Chinese Muslims a year for the last two decades.</p>   <p>In 2019, state security officials began investigating him from his home province of Ningxia over his Hajj organization activities.

   <p>"Islam enjoys the protection of our country's constitution, and completing the Hajj is the most important of the Five Pillars of Islam," Ma hand wrote in an appeal letter seen by NPR. "My country's official policy is to manage religion according to the law, but in practice, many citizens experience restrictions over legal religious activities, including the Hajj."</p>   <p>China runs state-approved tours to Mecca, but that was not an option for the pilgrims NPR contacted. The waiting list for the limited number of Hajj spots Saudi Arabia allocates to Muslims in China is now at least five years long, said the pilgrims. Moreover, China forbids its public sector employees from completing the Hajj, regardless of their age. Employees risk losing their retirement pensions and other state-managed benefits if they go anyways.</p>    the age of 65 because of pandemic health restrictions. Those age restrictions </p>   <p>However, China's state-run Islamic Association, which organizes the country's approved Hajj delegations, only selected pilgrims below the age of 65, according to four people familiar with Hajj policy.</p>   <p>The Islamic Association and the government's religious affairs department did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.</p>   <p>"When we got word that several other pilgrims had made it out of the country, we resolved to make the Hajj together through our own means," said one of the pilgrims. The group of six left Qinghai the next day.</p>

   <h3 class="edTag">A long and winding road </h3>   <p>The group did not fly directly to Saudi Arabia, because previous travelers told them that was a giveaway to Chinese security officers that they were Hajj pilgrims.</p>   <p>Instead, the group first booked tickets to the southern city of Guangzhou, a major international transit hub. As soon as they landed, police officers from their hometown called one of them on their mobile phone, inquiring why they were leaving Qinghai province and whether they were planning to make the Hajj. The group replied to the officers that they were traveling for work, then switched off their phones.</p>   <p>Panicked, the group decided to fly to central China instead, transferring through two more domestic airports before flying to Malaysia, a majority Muslim nation in Southeast Asia.</p>   <p>Every time they went through airport security check, they said they were careful to keep silent.

   <p>To hide their faith, the group removed any veils and donned new athletic clothes they bought the day before. "I felt almost naked," said one of the older female travelers. She said she had never taken off her veil in public since girlhood.</p>   <p>One of the pilgrims was briefly stopped, because immigration officials noticed her travel documents listed her as ethnically Hui. She said she was leaving for a vacation, and they let her through.</p>   <p>After landing in Malaysia, the group immediately went to visit one of Kuala Lumpur's biggest mosques. There, surrounded by reminders of Islamic piety, the stress of the last week sunk in and collapsing at the thick prayer rugs under their feet, they began to weep.</p>
