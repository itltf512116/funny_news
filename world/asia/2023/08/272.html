   <p>The United States has accused Russia of trying to do major arms deals with North Korea, following a new U.S. intelligence report that claimed the two countries were "actively advancing" high-level talks for additional weapons to support Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.</p>   <p>On Wednesday, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, stood alongside her counterparts from Japan, South Korea and Britain to condemn Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu for going to a recent military parade in North Korea, also known as the DPRK. </p>   <p>"The United States is now able to share that Shoigu's visit was more than just a photo op," Thomas-Greenfield said. "Russia used this visit to the DPRK to try to convince Pyongyang to sell artillery ammunition to Russia."</p>

   <p>Washington and its Asian allies' relations with both Pyongyang and Moscow have continued to deteriorate since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>   <p>On Wednesday, South Korea said North Korea launched two short-range ballistic missiles, hours after the U.S. flew at least one long-range bomber to the Korean Peninsula in warnings to Pyongyang.</p>
