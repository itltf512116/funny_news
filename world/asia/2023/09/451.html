   <p>President Biden said Sunday his , as well as strengthening partnerships with Japan, Australia and other countries, was "not about containing China. It's about having a stable" Asia-Pacific region.  </p>   <p>"I don't want to contain China. I just want to make sure we have a relationship with China that is on the up and up squared away everybody knows what it's all about," Biden said at a news conference following a bilateral meeting with the head of Vietnam's Communist Party. "And one of the ways you do that is you make sure that we are talking about the same thing.</p>

   <p>Biden, who hasn't met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 10 months, denied the lack of top-level meetings was destabilizing Sino-U.S. relations. He said his team and staff still meet with their Chinese counterparts, but added Xi "had his hands full right now."</p>   <p>"He has overwhelming unemployment. One of the major economic tenets of his plan is not working through he's trying to figure out." But, he said, "I hope I get to see Mr. Xi sooner rather than later."</p>   <p>The two men last met in November 2022 on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali.</p>   <p>"I want to see China succeed economically, but I want to see them succeed by the rules," Biden said.</p>   <p>Earlier, following a meeting with Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of Vietnam's Communist Party, Biden said the U.S. had "strengthened our ties with another critical Indo-Pacific partner." </p>   <p>Vietnam elevated relations with the U.S. to the level of a comprehensive strategic partner, the highest level of international partnership. Vietnam accords that status, long coveted by Washington, to four other nations: China, India, Russia and South Korea.  </p>

   <p>The move is significant as the U.S. tries to counter China's diplomatic and military heft in the region; Washington views Vietnam as a pivotal nation in its regional strategy; Vietnam has pushed back against China's policy in the region, as Beijing claims waters that Hanoi says belongs to it. </p>   <p>In Hanoi Sunday, Biden met with Trong and called the two countries "critical partners at what I would argue is a very critical time." Speaking through an interpreter, Trong said the two countries' partnership had grown by "leaps and bounds." Vietnam's human-rights record remained a concern, however. Biden said he brought up the issue, but Trong emphasized the importance of "non-interference in domestic affairs."   </p>   new investments in a rail line that will connect Angola with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.</p>
