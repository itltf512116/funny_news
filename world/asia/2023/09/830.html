   <p>U.S. officials said King was transferred to China where he was handed over to the United States. A Defense Department official told NPR Wednesday afternoon King was on his way to a military hospital in San Antonio, Texas.</p>   <p>"Pvt. King appears to be in good health and good spirits as he makes his way home," said a senior Biden administration official, who asked not to be named when briefing reporters on details before the transfer was made public.</p>   <p>U.S. officials spent weeks negotiating King's release. Since North Korea and the United States do not have diplomatic relations, Washington used other channels, including Swedish diplomats.</p>    that King was open to seeking refuge in North Korea or a third country.</p>
