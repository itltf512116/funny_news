   <p>In 2019, NPR published a story about Renee Bach, an American missionary who opened a clinic in Uganda to treat malnourished children.</p>   <p>The headline: </p>   <p>Now HBO is airing a three-part documentary on Bach, premiering on September 26. The title is: S. HBO states that the documentary will examine "missionary work in Uganda, where an American is accused of causing the death of vulnerable Ugandan children by dangerously treating them despite having no medical training."</p>   <p>In the NPR story, correspondent Nurith Aizenman detailed how Bach had volunteered at a missionary-run orphanage in Uganda for 9 months, came home to Virginia and then at age 19 returned to Uganda to set up her own charity – it felt like a calling from God, she told NPR in an interview.</p>   </p>   <p>A year later, we published  whose children died at Bach's center: "Bach was being sued by Gimbo Zubeda, whose son Twalali Kifabi was one of those children, as well as by Kakai Annet, whose son Elijah Kabagambe died at home soon after treatment by the charity.</p>   <p>"Under the agreement ... Bach and the charity — Serving His Children — have jointly agreed to pay about $9,500 to each of the mothers, with no admission of liability."</p>   <p>NPR reached out to Bach and her lawyers this week for any updates. Bach referred us to her lawyers, who did not respond.</p>
