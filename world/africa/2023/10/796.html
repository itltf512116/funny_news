   <p>On Wednesday, a court in Lagos granted the police 21 days to hold them in custody. Marley is now being questioned by police, who have not given further details on the case.<strong></strong></p>   <p>An unnamed nurse has also been arrested, police spokesperson Hundeyin said.</p>   <p>But outrage has been largely directed at, the boss of Mohbad's former label, for alleged abuse against Mohbad before he died.</p>   <p>A year ago, Mohbad left Marley's Marlian Records label. Following his departure, Mohbad claimed he suffered a campaign of abuse and attempts on his life by figures from the label, led by Marley.</p>   <p>Last October, Mohbad posted a on Twitter, now X, of blood oozing from a wound on his shoulder and claimed he was attacked by Marley and others from the music label for wanting to leave. In August, he said Marley's label had pressured promoters to cancel his shows.</p>   <p>Marley has denied all the allegations and said in a statement onlast month he was "shattered" by news of Mohbad's death. Sam Larry has also denied any involvement.</p>   <p>Marley is an  and a supporter of Lagos governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Marley campaigned in elections for Sanwo-Olu in February. Sanwo-Olu said anyone found guilty of Mohbad's death would face justice and called for witnesses to come forward. He has not yet reacted publicly to Marley's detention by police.</p>   <aside id="ad-secondary-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>Days of anger following Mohbad's death culminated in protests across the country last month. The protests included some radio stations in Nigeria pulling Marley's music from their airwaves.</p>   <p>Tunde Olawuwo, station manager for Splash FM Ibadan, one of the stations that has stopped playing Marley's songs, said the move by police to question Marley was a positive step but more needed to be done.</p>   <p>"Because it can only mean the police are listening to the demands people are making, but what we want and hope for is a fair investigation. One that is open and transparent," he said.</p>   <p>Police have exhumed Mohbad's body and carried out an autopsy, but the results have not yet been released. Police have not responded to NPR's questions on the autopsy.</p>
