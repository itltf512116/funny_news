   <p>Futpro, which represents women soccer players in Spain, expressed "firm and resounding condemnation of behaviors that violate the dignity of women." </p>   <p>"From our association we ask the Royal Spanish Football Federation to implement the necessary protocols, ensure the rights of our players and adopt exemplary measures. It is essential that our team, the current world champion, is always represented by figures who project values ​​of equality and respect in all areas," . </p>   <p>"We also call on the Higher Sports Council so that, within its powers, it actively supports and promotes prevention and intervention in the face of sexual harassment or abuse, machismo and sexism," Futpro concluded.</p>   <p>There had previously been a disconnect between what Hermoso had expressed just after the game, and what the federation later released in a statement it attributed to her.</p>    it said was from Hermoso in which she downplayed the events' severity calling it "a mutual gesture," though  that Hermoso did not actually write or say the statement. </p>   <p>FIFA says the events involving Rubiales may constitute violations to , pointing to paragraphs that address offensive behavior and the obligation to comply with FIFA's rules and principles of fair play. It says a person may be subject to discipline for, among other things, violating the basic rules of decent conduct; using offensive gestures, signs or language; or behaving in a way that brings the sport of soccer and/or FIFA into disrepute.</p>   <p>On Tuesday, Spain's acting prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, rebuked Rubiales: "It was an unacceptable gesture and Mr. Rubiales' apologies are not enough."</p>
