   <p>KYIV, Ukraine — Three people have died during a night of air strikes and intense shelling across Ukraine, officials said Sunday, while Moscow's second-largest airport briefly suspended flights following a foiled drone attack near the Russian capital.</p>   <p>Two people were killed and four more were injured following a Russian air strike in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, said the head of the local regional military administration, Oleh Syniehubov.</p>   <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a guided bomb had hit a blood transfusion center in the area's Kupyan district late on August 5.</p>   <p>"This war crime alone says everything about Russian aggression," Zelenskyy wrote on social media. "Defeating terrorists is a matter of honor for everyone who values life."</p>

   <p>The drone was destroyed by air defense systems in the Podolsk region of the Moscow suburbs, the Russian defense ministry said.</p>   <p>Authorities in Ukraine, which generally avoids commenting on attacks on Russian soil, didn't say whether it launched the raid.</p>   <p>Flights were last halted at the airport on July 30, when two drones crashed into the Moscow City business district after being jammed by Russian air defenses.</p>   <p>The attack was one of four strikes on the Russian capital in the space of a month, spotlighting Moscow's vulnerability as Russia's war in Ukraine drags into its second year.</p>   <p>The attempted drone strike followed a night of heavy clashes across Ukraine. The Ukrainian air force reported Sunday that Russian forces had launched 70 attack drones and air and sea missiles overnight.</p>   <p>The bombardment reportedly included cruise missiles launched from aircraft over the Caspian Sea and Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 strike UAVs.</p>   <p>Serhiy Tyurin, deputy head of Ukraine's Khmelnytsky region military administration, said Sunday that Russian missiles had damaged several buildings in the area, injuring one and sparking a fire in a warehouse. IN Ukraine's eastern Kupyan region, a 55-year-old man was hospitalized after missiles struck local houses and farm buildings. The attack also ignited a forest fire, officials said on social media.</p>   <aside id="ad-secondary-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>In the Russian-held city of Donetsk, Ukrainian shelling also set alight the main building of the M. Tugan-Baranovsky University of Economics and Trade, said the Moscow-installed head of the illegally annexed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin.</p>   <p>Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry said that the blaze caused the building's roof to collapse, but that there were no casualties.</p>
