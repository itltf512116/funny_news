   <p>MOSCOW — Russian aviation authorities say Wagner Group mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was on the passenger list of a plane that crashed northwest of Moscow on Wednesday that left no survivors. Yet officials have stopped short of directly confirming Prigozhin's death or the cause of the crash.</p>   <p>Here's what we do — and don't — know so far:</p>

   <h3 class="edTag">The crash</h3>   <p> showed the business jet making a routine flight from Moscow to St. Petersburg before suddenly losing altitude a little over 30 minutes into its journey. Witness video appears to show the plane hurtling toward a field, with possibly one of its wings severed. Subsequent  show the plane engulfed in flames. While not independently confirmed by NPR, the videos appear to match the location of the crash and plane.</p>

   <p>Rescue crews say they later recovered the remains of all the people on board. The crash scene, located near the village of Kuzenkhiino in Russia's Tver region some 185 miles northwest of Moscow, has been sealed off by police and the victims' remains reportedly removed to a local morgue. Russia's Investigative Committee — a Kremlin loyalist body with powers akin to the FBI — has opened a criminal investigation. Aviation authorities have launched parallel probes into the cause of the crash.</p>

   <p>The crash comes exactly two months after Prigozhin led a failed mutiny against Russia's military leadership over its perceived failures in the war in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin  took to the airwaves to insist the Wagner rebels would be punished as traitors.</p>   <p>He and Prigozhin later brokered a deal that ended the rebellion in exchange for the rebels' amnesty and exile in neighboring Belarus. The future for Prigozhin and his Wagner forces has been a source of intense speculation ever since. Various unconfirmed reports had Prigozhin spotted in Belarus, Africa and within Russia itself.</p>
