   <p>During the early weeks of the war,  Pilshchykov as he and other Ukrainian pilots scrambled to prevent Russia from gaining air superiority.</p>   <p>"We were waiting for a much more effective threat from the Russian side," he said.</p>   <p>Remarkably, Ukraine's tiny fleet of Soviet-era MiG-29 planes managed to hold off Russia's larger fleet of newer, more sophisticated jet fighters.</p>

   <p>But right from the start, Pilshchykov said his country needed more advanced U.S.-made F-16s to win the war.</p>   <p>"It's a great problem to fight with their fighters for us because they have an advantage in this technology," he said. "Unfortunately our jets are not capable to be effective against them."</p>

   <p>During Tuesday's ceremony, at the Partiarchal Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Pilshchykov was honored by fellow members of his 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade.</p>   <p>While priests chanted prayers, a blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag was draped over the aviator's coffin. Members of his family and the public placed asters and roses next to his officer's cap.</p>   <p>"He was a very smart guy, just a great pilot," said one of Pilshchykov's fellow pilots, who declined to give his name for security reasons.</p>

   <p>In the end, one of "Juice's" biggest contributions to the war effort may have been advocating in interviews, like the one with NPR, for Western militaries to donate F-16 jets to Ukraine.</p>   <p>He lived long enough to see the U.S. finally agree to allow countries, including  and Norway, to contribute dozens of the more advanced fighters. That decision came earlier this month.</p>   <p>The  to train a small number of Ukrainian pilots.</p>   <p>Ukraine is now in desperate need of enough aviators to fly the F-16s expected to arrive next year. Which means this accident was a symbolic loss, but also devastating in practical terms.</p>
