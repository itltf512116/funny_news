She says the country is still overcoming the legacy of the Soviet era, when the government sometimes said dissidents had "psychiatric problems" and locked them in mental institutions. She's shown here meeting with students in Paris last December.

   <p>KYIV, Ukraine — How are you?</p>   <p>In Ukraine, this question is much more than a casual conversation starter. It's an invitation to express how you're coping with the war.</p>   <p>"This question becomes like a form of love, an act of love. We ask because we understand that it's a part of our inner therapy," said art historian Halyna Hleba.</p>

   <p>Hleba is one of the curators of a large art exhibit — called "How Are You?" — featuring scores of works created by Ukrainians since Russia launched its full-scale invasion 18 months ago.</p>   <p>The paintings, sketches, sculpture and video are on display at Ukrainian House, a sprawling cultural center in Kyiv. The exhibit goes well beyond art, trying to get visitors thinking — and talking — about their mental health.</p>   <p>Hleba wrote the words stenciled onto the wall at the beginning of the exhibit, which fills the five-story center.</p>

   <p>Ukraine can calculate the agony of war in many ways: lives lost, homes destroyed, families turned into refugees.</p>   <p>Yet there's also trauma that's harder to measure — this collective mental health crisis the war has inflicted. Men and women, young and old, soldiers and civilians are all trying to cope.</p>

   <p>She notes that some Ukrainians, particularly the older generation, are still wary of raising mental health issues. This can be traced directly to the Soviet era, when the government often claimed political dissidents had "psychiatric problems" and locked them up in mental institutions.</p>   <p>"This fear still exists," she said. "But people need to understand that it is no longer the case. It's different now. That's why we need to inform people and help them understand about mental health care. It's not scary."</p>   , adding that many therapists like herself are being overwhelmed with requests for treatment.</p>   <p>For Korolovych, the war's trauma is personal. She lost her husband to a Russian missile strike last year, just days after he joined the military.</p>   <p>"Ukrainians have been living in a permanent state of bereavement for the past 18 months," she said. "When I was experiencing bereavement, I lived through the experience with other widows who also lost their husbands."</p>   <p>She's also been surprised by some of the responses she's received from patients.</p>   <p>Anecdotally, she says, more married patients are now coming to her saying they want a divorce.</p>   <p>Also, some Ukrainians have been emboldened by the way the country has responded to the Russian invasion. In some cases, they've shaken off past feelings of helplessness.</p>   <p>"We are learning how to get out of this position as a victim. We are learning how to ask for help," she said.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">An online test for anxiety and depression</h3>   <p>A recently formed Ukrainian company, , is trying to nudge this process forward.</p>

   <p>One image is mundane — an empty chair or a desk. The other is graphic and often disturbing — a malnourished child, a dead body on the battlefield, a cobra about to strike.</p>   <p>The sharply contrasting images appear for just a second and are then replaced by two more. By measuring eye movements to the millisecond, the test seeks to determine a person's unguarded reaction.</p>   <p>"You can't lie with your eyeball," said Havrysh. "We track it. We have those tiny, millisecond windows where you don't control, consciously, your eye, and we track it."</p>

"We found a lot that is very useful for mental health. It's a first step for treatment and for healing."</p>   <p>He says preliminary data suggests perhaps 15% of Ukrainian troops suffer from post-traumatic stress — a figure roughly in line with  of U.S. troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>   </p>
