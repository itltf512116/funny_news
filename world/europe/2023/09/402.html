   <p>LONDON — It sounds like the script of a Hollywood movie.</p>   <p>A former soldier accused of terrorism offenses escaped early Wednesday from a London prison, apparently by strapping himself to the undercarriage of a food delivery truck exiting the facility's kitchen.</p>

   <p>Daniel Abed Khalife, 21, had recently gotten a job in the prison kitchen. He was last seen there that morning, wearing a chef's uniform of red-and-white checkered pants, a white T-shirt and steel-toe boots.</p>   <p>A manhunt is underway amid concerns Khalife may try to flee the country. Ports and airports across the United Kingdom have beefed up screening, prompting chaos and longer security wait times. Traffic was  on a major highway leading to the Port of Dover — a main boat crossing from England to France — as police searched cars. Long lines of trucks were backed up at the port.</p>

                Prison guards walk around the sides of a truck at the gates of Wandsworth Prison in south London on Thursday, a day after terror suspect Daniel Abed Khalife escaped from the prison. British authorities have issued an all-ports alert to track down Khalife, a former soldier awaiting trial on terrorism charges. He escaped from jail by clinging to the bottom of a delivery truck.

   <p>Khalife escaped from the medium-security Wandsworth Prison, in south London. BidFood, the contractor that supplies food to the prison,  that its driver is cooperating with police.</p>   <p>Khalife had been awaiting trial for allegedly planting fake bombs at a military base where he'd been stationed in Staffordshire, England. He was also charged with gathering intelligence to possibly pass to foreign enemies — which U.K. media  is Iran — in violation of Britain's Official Secrets Act.</p>   <p>He was arrested in January, and was immediately discharged from the British army. Khalife has denied all the charges against him. His trial was slated to start in November.</p>   <p>Authorities say danger to the general public is low, but are asking anyone who spots Khalife not to approach him and to call police instead.</p>   <p>Prison breaks are rare in the U.K. One of the most infamous was by Ronnie Biggs, one of the so-called Great Train Robbers, who escaped from the same facility as Khalife in 1965. The  was in 1983, when 38 Irish Republican Army prisoners broke out of the maximum-security Maze prison in Northern Ireland.</p>   <aside id="ad-secondary-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>Khalife's escape has prompted questions about why a terrorism suspect was held in a medium-security facility, rather than a maximum-security one. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government says an independent investigation will happen "in due course."</p>   <p>"No stone must be left unturned in getting to the bottom of what happened," Chalk told lawmakers Thursday.</p>   <p>Opposition politicians have pinned blame on years of budget cuts under successive governments led by Sunak's Conservative Party, which have left the country's prison system overcrowded and short-staffed.</p>   <p>The former head of security at Wandsworth Prison told the BBC that Khalife's escape was "incredibly embarrassing" for the prison service.</p>   <p>"It simply beggars belief that a man being held on suspected terror charges was able to escape a prison by clinging to the bottom of a food delivery van," Shabana Mahmood, justice spokesperson for the main opposition Labour Party.</p>   <p>"How is such an escape even possible?" she asked.</p>
