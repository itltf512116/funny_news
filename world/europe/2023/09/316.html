   <p>PARIS — A ban on rental electric scooters took effect in Paris on Friday, becoming one of only a handful of places to do so.</p>   <p>Riders in the French capital started using stand-up e-scooters for rent in 2018. They became popular but dangerous, with reported injuries and even some deaths.</p>   <p>A few years ago, Paris cut back the number of companies operating the self-service rentals, which reduced scooters on the streets. The city tried to get riders off the sidewalks, to reduce their speeds and to park in designated places.</p>   <p>But even after the changes, in 2021, an Italian woman became the third fatality when she was hit by a scooter carrying two riders while she was walking along the Seine River in Paris.</p>    asking residents if they were for or against what it called "self-service scooters" in Paris: 89% voted to get rid of them, although the turnout was very low.</p>   <p>After the results, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo declared the app-based scooters would be gone in September.</p>   <p>The three companies that operated rental scooters had until Thursday to get some 15,000 of the vehicles off the streets of Paris.</p>   <p>Privately owned, non-rental scooters are still allowed.</p>   <p>In a press statement, the company Lime, which had been the largest e-scooter operator in the city, said it would redeploy the fleet to dynamic European cities where scooter use is growing.</p>   <p>Paris joins a growing  that have tried to either restrict or outright ban rental scooters. Some cities like Copenhagen previously banned them only to allow them back.</p>   <p>Some Parisians are disappointed to see the widely used mode of transport taken away.</p>   <p>"That's not good for us because the scooter was good to get around. ... It was more simple," said 17-year-old Maria Cantal. "It was very cool and so we're sad."</p>   <aside id="ad-secondary-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>Still, many residents welcome the news. </p>   <p>"Yes! They've disappeared. I'm so happy," said Nathalie Dupont, 56. "People still went too fast, and on the sidewalks. I have a friend who broke her leg and her arm when a scooter ran into her."</p>
