   <p>SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un promised his full support for Russian President Vladimir Putin in what he called a "fight against imperialism" in a summit in Russia, saying the countries' relations are a "."</p>   <p>Putin offered North Korea technological assistance to launch a satellite into space and said there are "possibilities" for military cooperation between them.</p>   <p>The meeting, which lasted more than four hours Wednesday in Russia's Far East, showed how geopolitical tensions have brought the two neighbors isolated by the West into closer alignment. It comes as the United States has  that Putin and Kim could strike an arms deal that would provide North Korean munitions for Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>    that Russia has already raised with North Korea the possibility of three-way naval exercises, including China.</p>   <p>Russia and North Korea can  militarily "within the framework of the current rules," Putin told the Russia 1 TV network, after his talks with Kim and his delegation.</p>

The two  in 2019.</p>   <p>Putin hosted Kim at the  in Russia's Far East, where Russian space agency officials briefed Kim on their work.</p>   <p>Asked if Russia would help North Korea with its satellites, Putin was quoted by Russian media as saying that was why Vostochny was chosen as the . North Korea  twice this year to put a spy satellite in orbit, but says it will try again next month.</p>   <p>North Korea did, however, highlight advances in its weaponry, launching two short-range ballistic missiles just hours before the summit, the  it has conducted such a test while Kim was out of the country.</p>   <p>There was no public mention at Wednesday's summit of Russia-North Korea cooperation on missiles. But both satellites and missiles rely on  rocket technology, and the U.S. and its allies have argued that North Korea uses space programs as cover for weapons tests, in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.</p>    says Moscow has traditionally been cautious about sharing sensitive military technologies with Pyongyang, and is not comfortable with North Korea's nuclear arsenal.</p>   <p>"They don't like it because Russia still commits to the cause of nuclear nonproliferation and missile nonproliferation," he says. "But still, they have another consideration, which is strategic and geopolitical."</p>   <p>And as the U.S. ramps up its military presence and  in Asia, Wi adds, Russia's considerations are increasingly driven by geopolitics.</p>   <p>Hong Min, a North Korea expert at the , a government-funded think tank in Seoul, believes that Russia's perception of a U.S. threat on its eastern flank will cause it to drop previous inhibitions about helping Pyongyang.</p>   <p>"I believe the plan is for Russia to provide technical assistance in stages for North Korea's needs, such as reentry technology for ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic missiles], and advancement of hypersonic missiles and SLBMs [submarine-launched ballistic missiles],"<strong> </strong>Hong says.</p>   <p>In any event, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the two neighbors'  in sensitive areas should not be made public.</p>   <p>Putin said Kim would continue his visit to Russia following their talks, including a visit to the port city of Vladivostok, home to the  of the Russian navy's Pacific fleet.</p>   <p></p>
