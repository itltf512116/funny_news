   <p>MOSCOW — In closely watched talks in the southern Russian resort city of Sochi, Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected efforts by his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to revive a United Nations-backed deal to allow the safe passage of grain from Ukraine — the latest setback in the grain deal since Moscow exited it in July.</p>   <p>In a news conference at the conclusion of the one-day summit on Monday, Putin recycled a litany of complaints about the U.N. deal, arguing the agreement helped Ukraine export its grain but repeatedly failed to live up to promises to ease Russia's agriculture trade.</p>    nearly 33 million metric tons (36 million tons) of grain and other commodities to leave three Ukrainian ports safely despite the war.</p>   " ahead of the Erdogan talks. </p>   <p>With the grain deal remaining in limbo, the Turkish leader indicated his country was ready to help Russia move forward with a humanitarian initiative to provide free  — most of them Kremlin allies. </p>   <p>Since exiting the U.N. agreement, Moscow has taken to repeatedly attacking Ukraine's grain facilities in an apparent bid to further gut the country's agricultural economy.</p>   <p>Indeed, Russia launched missile strikes on grain stores in the Odesa region near Ukraine's border with NATO ally Romania, just a day before Erdogan's arrival. </p>   <p>Russia has also threatened to fire on commercial ships attempting to circumvent a Russian blockade — calling them legitimate military targets.</p>   <p>In his statement, Putin accused Ukraine of abusing the grain deal's humanitarian shipping corridor to strike civilian infrastructure — an apparent reference to repeated Ukrainian attacks on a key bridge linking the Russian mainland to Crimea.</p>   <p>Ukraine argues it respected the humanitarian corridor but that the bridge itself remains a legitimate target given its role in supplying Russian forces operating in southern Ukraine.</p>
