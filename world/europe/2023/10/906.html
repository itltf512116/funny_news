   <p>After almost six decades on the road in one of London's famous black cabs, this driver provides some priceless life lessons.</p>   <p><strong>Who is he? </strong>Michael Son, 80, lives in Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex, England, and has driven one of London's ubiquitous black cabs since 1965.</p>   <ul class="edTag">   <li>His encounter with passenger Dan Barker recently led to minor internet virality. The attention from this ride led the public to discover just some of the remarkable things Son has experienced in his years on the road.</li>   <li>In Barker's memory, Son said it was his last-ever ride as a cab driver and it was tradition that drivers give their first and last ride for free, so he wasn't going to be charged.</li>   <li>In Son's recollection, he had made a wrong turn and offered to give the ride for free. Barker said he was touched, regardless. Before getting out, he grabbed a photo of Son and , formerly known as Twitter.</li>   <li>Son has mostly retired, for the record, and did say it's a 300-some-year-old tradition for cab drivers to give their first ever ride for free, at least.</li>   </ul>   </p>&mdash; dan barker (@danbarker) </blockquote>

   <p><strong>What's the big deal? </strong></p>   <ul class="edTag">   <li>Barker's post received more than 3.4 million views, according to X. Though their versions of the interaction differ, both men were wholly unbothered by it and marveled at how a simple, nice interaction took off.</li>   <li>What's even more odd, though, is that when Barker posted this, a person responded and suggested that he donate to a cab charity. When Barker clicked on one called the , Son was in one of the photos on the website, standing next to the U.K.'s Queen Camilla. </li>   <li>"It's such an odd coincidence to get into somebody's cab in the first place, when they tell you that this is probably going to be their last-ever ride, let alone to then suddenly Google a charity and have them appear on your computer screen," Barker told NPR. </li>   <li>Son has been involved in the London Taxi Drivers' Charity for Children since the 1980s. The group brings special-needs and disadvantaged children to events like circuses and parades, and raises money to buy medical equipment. Son has served as the group's honorary chairman and as a member of the board.</li>   </ul>

For his decades of work with the charity, Son received thein 2019.</li>   <li>Becoming a London cabbie is no small feat. To be certified, Son had to pass a test called referring to a driver's familiarity with London's streets and buildings. When he started training to be a cab driver, London was much smaller. Even back then it was incredibly difficult and took months, Son told NPR. "Now it's just grown exponentially and to try and learn it must be awful," he said. </li>   </ul>
