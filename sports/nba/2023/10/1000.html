					(Photo : Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images) SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH - LeBron James (#6) of the Los Angeles Lakers is pressured by Damian Lillard (#0) of the Portland Trailblazers and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (#2) of the Oklahoma City Thunder during the first quarter in the 2023 NBA All Star Game between Team Giannis and Team LeBron at Vivint Arena on February 19, 2023 in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
				<p>Debating who the NBA's Greatest of All Time is can be contentious, but how about the Top 5 Greats?</p>
<p>Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's collection of NBA's 5 All-Time Starting might be something different from the rest. That is because he omitted the man in contention as the greatest of all time - Lebron James.</p>
<p>Appearing for NBA2k, the Canadian point guard shared his start lineup of all time, and a&nbsp;&nbsp;was the Los Angeles Lakers star, who is also the league's top scorer of all time.</p>
<p>"My All-Time starting 5 including me would be Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Kevin Durant," he said in the clip.</p>

<p>This appears a hot take as many publications, even NBA greats, always have LBJ on their list.</p>
<p>Then again, SGA may be one of those young players who see the league differently now. Instead of looking at players' legacy, they go about it from a personal standpoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;gets listed as the GOAT of some young players.</p>
<h2>SGA is also listed high by his contemporaries</h2>
<p>SGA made his All-Star debut last season, a testament of how he is gradually rising as one of the best players in the league.</p>
<p>The league is taking notice, and even&nbsp;&nbsp;what he can do.</p>
<p>Dallas Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic is one of those.</p>
<p>"Congratulations to Canada, they played great," Doncic told reporters during the recently concluded FIBA World Cup.</p>
<p>"They have one of the best players in the world and it was really tough to guard him."</p>
