				<p>Luka Doncic has at least a decade left to juice his prime years, and that might all be spent in the NBA, where he is still chasing his first championship.</p>
<p>Where will he be after the NBA? The Dallas Mavericks is 100 percent sure he will return to where he started - Real Madrid.</p>
<p>The finesse guard started his professional basketball career with the European giants before getting drafted by the Mavs in 2018 as their third overall pick.</p>
