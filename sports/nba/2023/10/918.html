				<p>Luka Doncic has at least a decade left to juice his prime years, and that might all be spent in the NBA, where he is still chasing his first championship.</p>
<p>Where will he be after the NBA? The Dallas Mavericks is 100 percent sure he will return to where he started - Real Madrid.</p>
<p>The finesse guard started his professional basketball career with the European giants before getting drafted by the Mavs in 2018 as their third overall pick.</p>

<p>He also assured them that he&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"I've got a lot of great memories and I'm happy to be back," Doncic said. "If I return to Europe one day, I'm sure it will be to Real Madrid. That's 100%."</p>

<p>"Nobody wanted to play more than me, I was very pissed off I couldn't play more," he was quoted as saying by&nbsp;<em>Hoops Hype</em>&nbsp;on X.</p>
<p>Doncic and the rest of the Mavs will have a&nbsp;&nbsp;after Real Madrid. They will play the Detroit Pistons for their last pre-season game.</p>
