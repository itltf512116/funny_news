					(Photo : Steph Chambers/Getty Images) PORTLAND, OREGON - Deandre Ayton (#2) of the Portland Trail Blazers poses for a portrait during Blazers Media Day at Veterans Memorial Coliseum on October 02, 2023 in Portland, Oregon.
				<p>DeAndre Ayton&nbsp;&nbsp;to have a fresh start with the Portland Trail Blazers.</p>
<p>But before embarking on his new journey, the former first overall pick of the 2018 NBA Draft had some parting words for his former team, the Phoenix Suns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm in an organization that wants me, and wants me to succeed. So there's a lot more passion when you feel that mentally, you've seen it physically as well. So there will be a lot more grit and a lot more domination this year," the 25-year-old said.</p>
<p>While the Bahamian center was not considered a flop, as he helped the Suns reach the 2021 NBA Finals, there were lingering questions about his motor and development within the team's fanbase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the clamors of some fans to deal him for additional depth, Ayton did not request a trade out of Phoenix during the summer.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;&nbsp;that constant trade talks about him have taken a toll on his mental health and play on the court.</p>
<p>"Look at the position I was playing in, the environment I was playing in. It can sometimes put a toll on your mental," Ayton admitted during the Blazers' media day on Monday, October 2.</p>

<h2>DeAndre Ayton comes up with new nickname</h2>
<p>Ayton was visibly upbeat and enthusiastic as he was introduced to his new team this week, and&nbsp;&nbsp;with an interesting nickname for himself.</p>
<p>"I bring dominance. My name is DominAyton," the 2019 NBA All-Rookie First Team said.</p>
