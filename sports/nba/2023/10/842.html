					(Photo : Ezra Shaw/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - A general view of the Golden State Warriors playing against the Los Angeles Lakers in a preseason game at Chase Center on October 05, 2019 in San Francisco, California. 
				<p>Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) commissioner Cathy Engelbert&nbsp;&nbsp;that an expansion franchise will be coming to the Bay Area for the 2025 season, owned and operated by seven-time NBA champions Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>This will be the WNBA's first expansion since the Atlanta Dream joined the league in 2008. The franchise will play their home games at the Warriors' home ground, Chase Center in San Francisco.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled about expanding to the Bay Area and bringing the WNBA to a region with passionate basketball fans and a strong history of supporting women's basketball," Engelbert said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the team will be headquartered in the Warriors' former practice facility and front office in Oakland, where the NBA franchise played from 1971 to 2019.</p>
<p>The team&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden State," mirroring their NBA counterparts, per Ramona Shelbourne of&nbsp;<em>ESPN</em>. However, the official team name has not been revealed yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Warriors will be the sixth NBA franchise to have a WNBA team, joining the ranks of the Indiana Pacers (Indiana Fever), Minnesota Timberwolves (Minnesota Lynx), Brooklyn Nets (New York Liberty), Phoenix Suns (Phoenix Mercury), and Washington Wizards (Washington Mystics).</p>

<h2>Another city expected to receive franchise&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The WNBA plans to award another city an expansion franchise later this year, with Portland&nbsp;&nbsp;for this opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The franchise will also begin to play in the 2025 season, bringing the total number of teams in the league to 14 by that time.</p>
