<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Houston Rockets small forward Dillon Brooks &nbsp;for his actions during his preseason debut with the team last Tuesday, October 10.</p>
<p>The league announced in a statement&nbsp;on Thursday, October 12, that they will fine the 27-year-old $25,000 for recklessly making contact with Indiana Pacers center Daniel Theis in the groin area with 7:27 left in the first quarter of the game.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The following was released by the NBA. </p>&mdash; NBA Communications (@NBAPR) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>Upon further review from the officials, the former Memphis Grizzlies player &nbsp;after being hit with a Flagrant Foul 2, leaving the game with one assist and two personal fouls.</p>
<p>Brooks asserted that the contact was unintentional.</p>
<p>"I tried to navigate a screen. I might have tapped him below the waist, but he got right back up. I don't know. It's weird that every time it happens to me, I get picked on. I guess it's part of reputation," Brooks said after Tuesday's game.</p>
<p>The Rockets won 122-103 at the Toyota Center in Houston.</p>

<h2>$25,000 is a drop in the bucket for Dillon Brooks</h2>
<p>The fine imposed represents a negligible sum for the Canadian player.</p>
<p>Brooks &nbsp;four-year contract with the Rockets valued at $80 million during the opening of free agency last July.</p>
<p>This substantial deal will allow the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup Best Defensive Player to earn $22,627,671 for the 2023-24 NBA season.</p>
<p>Thus, the $25,000 fine accounts for just 0.11 percent of his earnings for the upcoming campaign.</p>
