<p>"If it's up to me, absolutely. I'm back home with a great organization. An organization that believes in winning and does everything it can to win... It'd be a dream," the eight-time NBA All-Star said.</p>
<p>George &nbsp;to Los Angeles in the summer of 2019 following a trade from the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
<p>This move came after Kawhi Leonard, a free agent at the time, insisted that the Clippers acquire George to secure his signing with the team.</p>

<h2>Paul George, Clippers discussing contract extension</h2>
<p>The former Fresno State standout &nbsp;he has discussed a potential contract extension with the Clippers front office.</p>
<p>However, as of now, neither side is close to finalizing an agreement.</p>
