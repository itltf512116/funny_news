            <p>Damian Lillard, the newest star acquisition of the Milwaukee Bucks, recently discussed the roller-coaster offseason he experienced.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old initially requested a trade out of his longtime team, the Portland Trail Blazers, during the early stages of free agency last July.</p>
<p>Lillard&nbsp;&nbsp;Miami Heat as his preferred destination, with his agent Aaron Goodwin&nbsp;&nbsp;reiterating the seven-time All-Star's desire to move to the sunny Florida city.</p>
<p>However, as months went by, no substantial trade discussions had commenced, and Portland had turned down Miami's initial proposal for their all-time leading scorer in franchise history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It was anything to go against what I would have wanted. That part was irritating. Just based off how it was happening, I knew [it wouldn't be Miami]," the 2018 All-NBA First Team&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The Athletic</em>.</p>
<p>Given how things unfolded, Lillard had already realized he would not end up at his desired destination.</p>
<p>"[Portland] hadn't talked to Miami. So once it started happening like that, then I started hearing about all these other random teams, I was like, 'I'm probably not going to Miami.' So I wasn't holding on to that," the 2013 NBA Rookie of the Year added.</p>

<h2>Lillard gives greenlight to Milwaukee</h2>
<p>After recognizing that Miami was no longer feasible, Goodwin inquired whether the Bucks were actively seeking his NBA 75th Anniversary member client.</p>
<p>Following the informal confirmation that Lillard was eager to join forces with the Bucks, talks were initiated.</p>
