					(Photo : Ezra Shaw/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - Klay Thompson (#11) of the Golden State Warriors shoots the ball against the Sacramento Kings during Game Four of the Western Conference First Round Playoffs at Chase Center on April 23, 2023 in San Francisco, California.
				<p>Klay Thompson is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest shooters in NBA history and among the well-decorated and famous players around the league today.</p>
<p>The well-known sniper has been an integral part of the Golden State Warriors dynasty that won four NBA championships during the past decade, and being one of the best at a particular and essential skill of the game has rewarded him handsomely in terms of financial matters.</p>
<p>Given his remarkable skills, numerous achievements, and global popularity, the question arises: How much is Klay Thompson's net worth in 2023?&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Klay Thompson's Net Worth 2023: $70 Million</h2>
<p>The 33-year-old Thompson is worth an impressive $70 million as of 2023, according to several sources such as&nbsp;,&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The five-team NBA All-Star was listed by business and financial magazine&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;as the 23rd highest-paid athlete in the world in 2023, earning $60.9 million over the past year.</p>
<p>A significant portion of his income, approximately one-third, comes from various endorsement deals and partnerships, amounting to $20 million.</p>
<p>The remainder of his earnings, $40.9 million, is derived from his salary as a member of the Golden State Warriors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two-time All-NBA Third Team selection is set to earn $43.2 million in the final year of his deal with the Bay Area team in the 2023-24 season. This amount represents a 6.45 percent increase from the previous season, according to&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The figure positions him as the 12th highest-paid player in the NBA, and he is also the second-highest-paid member of the Warriors roster, trailing his fellow Splash Brother, Stephen Curry.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Klay Thompson's Wealth&nbsp;</h2>
<p>As of the conclusion of the 2022-23 NBA season, the former Washington State guard has accumulated $222,944,784 in NBA salary over his twelve-season career in the world's premier basketball league, per&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Thompson&nbsp;&nbsp;endorsement deal with Chinese sportswear company Anta in 2015, which helped him become popular in the Asian country.&nbsp;&nbsp;was interesting.</p>
<p>"I knew with the other brands in the States, whether it was Nike or Adidas, it was going to be tough for me to get a signature shoe. I knew with Anta, I would have so much input creatively. I was going to hopefully be the Michael Jordan one day of Anta. That really resonated with me, and knowing that I could be really big in China, was cool to me," the sharpshooter confessed.</p>
<p>After releasing two signature shoes with the brand, the four-time NBA champion&nbsp;&nbsp;long-term ten-year contract in 2017 worth $80 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to his partnership with Anta, Thompson boasts a diverse array of endorsement deals spanning various sectors.</p>
<p>These include collaborations with video game publisher Activision, body wash brand Bevel, mobile payment company Block Inc, restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings, NFT collectibles company Dapper Labs, sports merchandise retailer Fanatics, toy manufacturer Hasbro (NERF), and menswear brand Hugo Boss.</p>
<p>The 2016 NBA Three-Point Contest champion also has deals with healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente, German car brand Mercedes-Benz, soda company PepsiCo, burger chain Shake Shack, luxury Swiss watchmaker Tissot, and water brand Waiakea Water.</p>
