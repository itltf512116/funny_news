					(Photo : Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - Jrue Holiday (#21) of the Milwaukee Bucks reacts to a fan's comment during the second quarter against the Golden State Warriors at Chase Center on March 11, 2023 in San Francisco, California.

<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Jrue Holiday's three-year stay in the city of Milwaukee as a member of the Bucks came to an abrupt end just over a week ago.</p>
<p>The Bucks traded the two-time NBA All-Star to acquire Damian Lillard, marking a significant change in Holiday's family life, which his wife Lauren talked about.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lauren Holiday spoke about her husband Jrue&#39;s trade from Milwaukee.<br><br>(via laurenholiday12/IG) </p>&mdash; NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>Lauren &nbsp;Jrue learned about his trade during a call after taking a nap, with no prior indication or warning from the franchise about the potential move.</p>
<p>The former women's soccer player &nbsp;their children formed friendships and connections within their community.</p>
<p>Their family values family and friendships, and they invest in the cities where they play, which is why she is frustrated about the lack of understanding of the human element of these kinds of transactions.</p>
<p>"This is more than business. Not because we're offended by it but, because we are people, we're humans, we have relationships, dreams, and a connection to where we play," the 36-year-old wrote.</p>
<p>Lauren was a former soccer player who played for the United States women's national team, winning two Olympic gold medals and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.</p>

<h2>Holiday was traded twice.</h2>
<p>The Bucks initially dealt the defensive stalwart to the Portland Trail Blazers, but the team is already settled with their guard lineup, leading them to look out for another potential transaction.</p>
<p>Many championship-contending teams were interested in acquiring Holiday, and he ultimately landed with the Boston Celtics four days after the initial trade.</p>
