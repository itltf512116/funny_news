            <p>The Indiana Pacers are already bracing for their future, and part of that is&nbsp;&nbsp;head coach Rick Carlisle on the sidelines.</p>
<p>The Pacers&nbsp;&nbsp;multi-year contract extension with Carlisle, who has mentored the team since the 2021-22 season.</p>
<p>"It goes without saying that Coach Carlisle is one of the most creative and successful coaches in the history of the league, so there was never a question that he continues to be the right person to lead our team," Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 64-year-old's current tenure marks his second spell with the team, as he previously coached the Pacers for four seasons from 2003-04 to 2006-07.</p>
<p>He was notably the team's head coach during the infamous "Malice at the Palace" brawl between the Pacers and the Detroit Pistons in 2004.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carlisle coached the Dallas Mavericks from 2008-09 to 2020-21, winning an NBA championship in 2011.</p>

<h2>Rumors of Carlisle not wanting to rebuild</h2>
<p>After the Pacers went 25-57 in Carlisle's first season back with the team, there were speculations that he may not have anticipated a rebuilding phase and was potentially interested in transitioning to a role in the front office.</p>
<p>The 2002 NBA Coach of the Year&nbsp;&nbsp;last year.</p>
<p>"I'm here to coach this team for the long-haul if they'll have me. And I'm not afraid of any aspect of a rebuild one single bit," Carlisle clarified.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
