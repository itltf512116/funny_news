					(Photo : Patrick McDermott/Getty Images) MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN - Anthony Davis (#3) of the Los Angeles Lakers dribbles the ball against Giannis Antetokounmpo (#34) of the Milwaukee Bucks during the first half of the game at Fiserv Forum on December 02, 2022 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
				<p>The power forward position is home to some of the league's most talented players, possessing a variety of skill sets that make huge contributions to teams' success.</p>
<p>An elite power forward holds significant value in today's basketball landscape, often distinguishing the line between a team capable of contending for a championship and one that is not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we approach the 2023-24 NBA season, here are the top five power forwards across the league anticipated to make substantial impacts for their respective teams.</p>
<h3>5. Zion Williamson - New Orleans Pelicans</h3>
<p>There's no denying that Williamson is one of the most talented players in the league&nbsp;&nbsp;in his career due to various injuries.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old made his second NBA All-Star team despite playing only 29 games in 2022-23, and he didn't even get to play in the exhibition game.</p>
<p>The former Duke star is one of the most efficient scorers in the league, averaging 25.8 points per game while shooting 60.5 percent in his career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, only his body and health are holding him back from a higher spot on this list.</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 Stats:&nbsp;</strong>26.0 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 4.6 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.6 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:</strong>&nbsp;$34,005,250</p>
<h3>4. Jaren Jackson Jr. - Memphis Grizzlies&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The 24-year-old had a breakout season last year, making his first All-Star appearance and&nbsp;Defensive Player of the Year award.</p>
<p>Jackson was also named in his second straight NBA All-Defensive First Team. He has led the league in blocks in the past two seasons, including a career-best 3.1 BPG in 2022-23.</p>
<p>He also averaged career highs in rebounds and field goal percentage last season, although he is still prone to foul trouble at times.</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 Stats:&nbsp;</strong>18.6 PPG, 6.8 RPG, 1.0 APG, 1.0 SPG, 3.0 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:</strong>&nbsp;$27,102,202&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Pascal Siakam - Toronto Raptors</h3>
<p>Despite failing to make the postseason, the 29-year-old delivered a remarkable individual season,&nbsp;&nbsp;All-Star appearance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Siakam averaged career highs in points and assists, leading the league in minutes for the second consecutive year.</p>
<p>The Cameroonian is poised to be the main man again for Toronto for the upcoming campaign.</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 Stats:</strong>&nbsp;24.2 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 5.8 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.6 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:</strong>&nbsp;$37,893,408&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>2. Anthony Davis - Los Angeles Lakers</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Lakers had a crazy season in 2022-23, making a deep playoff run after their terrible start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 30-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;in the playoffs, maintaining a huge inside presence as they eliminated defending champions Golden State Warriors in the second round.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Davis averaged an astounding 14.1 rebounds and 3.1 blocks throughout 23 games in the postseason, both career-highs.</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 Stats:&nbsp;</strong>25.9 PPG, 12.5 RPG, 2.6 APG, 1.1 SPG, 2.0 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:&nbsp;</strong>$40,600,080</p>
<h3>1. Giannis Antetokounmpo - Milwaukee Bucks</h3>
<p>Not only is the 28-year-old unquestionably the premier power forward in the NBA, but he has also been&nbsp;&nbsp;overall by&nbsp;<em>ESPN&nbsp;</em>for the second straight year.</p>
<p>The Greek star also topped the annual NBA GM Survey for the top power forward in the league&nbsp;, garnering 97 percent of the votes.</p>
<p>Antetokounmpo put on another solid campaign last year, leading the Bucks to the best record in the NBA at 58-24. However, they were upset in five games in the first round of the playoffs by the Miami Heat.</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 Stats:&nbsp;</strong>31.1 PPG, 11.8 RPG, 5.7 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.8 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:</strong>&nbsp;$45,640,084&nbsp;</p>
