					(Photo : Maddie Malhotra/Getty Images) BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - Jayson Tatum (#0) of the Boston Celtics gives an interview during Boston Celtics Media Day at The Auerbach Center on October 2, 2023 in Boston, Massachusetts. 
				<p>The Boston Celtics stand as the most accomplished franchise in NBA history, boasting a shared record for the most NBA championships and the highest number of recorded wins in league history.</p>
<p>Franchise star Jayson Tatum&nbsp;&nbsp;that the expectation of delivering a championship in Boston is constant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 25-year-old admitted that there has been added pressure to achieve greater success, particularly since their appearance in the 2022 NBA Finals,&nbsp;&nbsp;a six-game defeat at the hands of the Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>"There are a handful of teams that realistically have a shot to win it. And over the last year or two, we've been one of those teams," Tatum said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two-time All-NBA First Team member also knows that their championship window isn't going to last forever, and they are hoping to maximize the opportunity and talent they have right now.</p>
<p>"We need to approach every season like this is the year we have to make it happen, because you don't want to take any time for granted," Tatum declared.</p>

<h2>New look Celtics</h2>
<p>Boston has made radical changes on their roster that made the Finals just a year ago, parting ways with longstanding team members like Marcus Smart, Grant Williams, Robert Williams, and the reigning NBA Sixth Man of the Year, Malcolm Brogdon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite their relative success, the team hasn't gotten over the hump. By acquiring Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, they aim to surpass their eternal rivals, the Los Angeles Lakers, to be the league's winningest franchise again.</p>
