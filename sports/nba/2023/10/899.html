					(Photo : Jacob Kupferman/Getty Images) CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA - Tyler Herro (#14) of the Miami Heat reacts in the fourth quarter during their game against the Charlotte Hornets at Spectrum Center on February 25, 2023 in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
				<p>Miami Heat guard Tyler Herro has been a topic of trade discussions this summer and for several years, especially when the team explores the possibility of acquiring a high-profile player.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His name was floating once again during the Heat's attempts to acquire former Portland Trail Blazers point guard Damian Lillard, which was unsuccessful as the NBA 75th Anniversary Team member was ultimately traded to the Milwaukee Bucks.</p>
<p>It was reported that the Trail Blazers were not keen on including Herro in a trade package for Lillard.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the 23-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Trail Blazers had no interest in trading for him.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to go to Portland, so I'm glad Portland didn't want me. I just don't want to be in Portland. So it's not personal with Portland, at all," the 2022 NBA Sixth Man of the Year&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Sun Sentinel</em>.</p>
<p>The Heat drafted Herro with the 13th overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft after a single season of college basketball at the University of Kentucky.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tyler Herro's goal this season</h2>
<p>Entering the upcoming season, Herro does not see it as a "revenge tour," despite his name being involved in trade rumors for a significant portion of the summer. He revealed a much bigger goal for 2023-24.</p>
<p>"Honestly, my goal this year is to get my name untouchable. That's my goal. At the end of this season, they won't want to trade me," the former Kentucky player remarked&nbsp;&nbsp;Miami Herald.</p>
