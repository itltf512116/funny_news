<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?-->Milwaukee Bucks Twitter panicked early Thursday after news of Terry Stotts' sudden resignation as the team's assistant coach broke out.</p>
<p>The decision came out of nowhere and was fully unexpected, even by his former player and NBA All-Star Damian Lillard, who just like him, was a .</p>
<p>Stotts joined the Bucks over the summer as their offense coach. His time with the Portland Trail Blazers is a testament to how his coaching skills are up there in the NBA.</p>

<p>So what was it that led to Stotts' decision? <em>The Athletic</em>&nbsp;and Bucks beat writer Eric Nehm revealed that the reason can be traced to one .</p>
<p>Nehm wrote that rookie head coach Adrian Griffin was trying to wrap things up during a practice and informed everyone that coaches would have a separate meeting.</p>
<p>Stotts, whose coaching CV is way more stacked than Griffin's, did not join the coaches' huddle right away and instead talked to Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo.</p>
<p>Griffin called on Stotts again, but he insisted on more time with Giannis and Dame. At this point, the Bucks' head coach yelled again, an incident that the players and other staff witnessed.</p>
<h2>Conflict on who should be the leader of the pack?</h2>
<p>Griffin earlier said that even he was caught off guard by the development without getting into more details.</p>
<p>"I learned a lot from him in a very short time. He was really good at what he does. He made a decision - a personal decision - and we just have to respect that."</p>
<p>A clip of Griffin made the rounds on X, depicting how he seems &nbsp;of one of his staff.</p>
<p>"Life is good," he said at the end of the clip.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bucks Twitter was at a loss on how to deal with the development.</p>

<p>
</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What I got out of that is Stotts hasn&#39;t adjusted well to being an assistant. He hadn&#39;t been one since 2012. Lotta mehhh. Would have been nice to have him. But if it was going to be an issue. Better he&#39;s gone early. Show goes on!! </p>&mdash; Trey Crosby III Guru (@TCIIIESQ) </blockquote>
