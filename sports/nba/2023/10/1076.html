<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Andre Iguodala, best known for his time with the Golden State Warriors, &nbsp;from professional basketball on Friday, October 20.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old &nbsp;19 seasons in the NBA, the majority of them with the Dubs from 2013 to 2019 and then again from 2021 to 2023.</p>
<p>"It's just the right time. Time started to get limited for me, and I didn't want to put anything in the back seat. I didn't want to have to try to delegate time anymore," the 2012 NBA All-Star told <em>Andscape</em>&nbsp;in a phone interview.</p>
<p>The small forward wanted to allocate more time to his family, including his teenage son and two daughters.</p>
<p>Iguodala also acknowledged&nbsp;the considerable toll that his basketball career had on his body, often leaving him with persistent aches and discomfort.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On Episode 1 of  podcast, 4x NBA Champion and Finals MVP Andre Iguodala officially retires! explains why it was time for him to call it a career. </p>&mdash; SB Nation (@SBNation) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>He was the second-oldest active player in the league in 2022-23, playing only eight games after his season &nbsp;by a wrist injury.</p>

<h2>Andre Iguodala - vital dynasty contributor</h2>
<p>Iguodala played a pivotal role in all four of the Warriors' championship victories during their dynasty in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022, earning the NBA Finals MVP award in 2015.</p>
<p>Drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers as the 9th overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft, he spent his first eight seasons with the team and secured his lone All-Star selection during this time.</p>
<p>The 2014 NBA All-Defensive First Team also spent brief stints with the Denver Nuggets in 2013-14 and the Miami Heat in 2020-21. He made his sixth straight NBA Finals appearance with the Heat in 2020.</p>
