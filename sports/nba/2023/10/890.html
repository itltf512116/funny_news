<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The Los Angeles Clippers fell short of their objective to capture the NBA championship last season, a goal that has remained elusive since they acquired star players Kawhi Leonard and Paul George during the summer of 2019.</p>
<p>The two-time NBA Finals MVP missed the entire 2021-22 NBA season after suffering a partial ACL tear in his right knee during their second-round series against the Utah Jazz in the 2021 NBA Playoffs.</p>
<p>With the Clippers hoping to put their star back in action, Leonard &nbsp;they bypassed necessary steps to get him to full strength for the 2022-23 campaign.</p>
<p>"Last year, I think everybody was a little excited just by me coming back... We skipped some steps, I would say. That's on all of us in here. The front office, me included, and the coaching staff," the 32-year-old said.</p>

<p>The Clippers were eliminated in five games, and Leonard &nbsp;knee procedure last June.</p>
