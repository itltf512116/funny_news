<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The Los Angeles Clippers fell short of their objective to capture the NBA championship last season, a goal that has remained elusive since they acquired star players Kawhi Leonard and Paul George during the summer of 2019.</p>
<p>The two-time NBA Finals MVP missed the entire 2021-22 NBA season after suffering a partial ACL tear in his right knee during their second-round series against the Utah Jazz in the 2021 NBA Playoffs.</p>
<p>With the Clippers hoping to put their star back in action, Leonard &nbsp;they bypassed necessary steps to get him to full strength for the 2022-23 campaign.</p>
<p>"Last year, I think everybody was a little excited just by me coming back... We skipped some steps, I would say. That's on all of us in here. The front office, me included, and the coaching staff," the 32-year-old said.</p>

<h2>Kawhi Leonard got injured again</h2>
<p>The five-time NBA All-Star played 52 games in the regular season, and he delivered stellar performances in the first two games of their first-round showdown against the Phoenix Suns during the 2023 NBA Playoffs last April.</p>

<p>Despite the injury, Leonard managed to play through the pain in Game 2. However, he was later sidelined for the remainder of the series, putting the Clippers' championship hopes down the drain as they were also without George due to a sprained knee.</p>
<p>The Clippers were eliminated in five games, and Leonard &nbsp;knee procedure last June.</p>
