					(Photo : Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images) HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA - (L-R) Juan Toscano-Anderson, John Boyega, Draymond Green, Lil Wayne, Klay Thompson, Kameron Carter, Andre Iguodala, and Stephen Curry attend the 2022 ESPYs at Dolby Theatre on July 20, 2022 in Hollywood, California.
				<p>Not all NBA players are fond of Skip Bayless. Even some of his fellow&nbsp;&nbsp;for his "hot takes" and many other things.</p>
<p>Lil Wayne is a different story, though. The rapper is friends with Bayless, and that is all because of Stephen Curry.</p>
<p>GQ interviewed the duo, and there, they shared&nbsp;&nbsp;by their mutual admiration of Stephen Curry, a less-heralded NBA aspirant at that time compared to Blake Griffin.</p>

<p>The two bonded over the Golden State&nbsp;&nbsp;14 years ago, and they have been friends since.</p>
<p>"Two things came up in that meeting that really raised my eyebrows. I knew your work, but I didn't know you, and I didn't know your depth of sports knowledge," Bayless said, addressing Lil Wayne during the joint interview.</p>
<p>"But we were coming up to Steph Curry's draft, and I was a Steph Curry fan at Davidson. You shocked me, in a good way, because you said you would take Steph over Blake Griffin! Everybody at&nbsp;<em>ESPN</em>&nbsp;was head over heels with Blake Griffin because he could jump out of the gym. But [Griffin] stayed at Oklahoma for two years, and the good ones don't stay for two years!"</p>
<h2>What do people think of their friendship?</h2>
<p>Bayless and Lil Wayne being friends seems odd, but the pair maintained that they are compatible with each other.</p>
<p>"The first thing that people will say is that we seem like we're a lot alike," Wayne said when asked about people's opinion of their bond.</p>
<p>"I get that a whole lot, even from my mom. She'll say, "It looks like you and that man talk all damn day!"</p>
<p>However, they also disagree with many stuff, mainly sports conversation.</p>
