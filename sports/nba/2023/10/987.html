					(Photo : Matthew Stockman/Getty Images) DENVER, COLORADO - Nikola Jokic (#15) of the Denver Nuggets drives to the basket against Bam Adebayo (#13) of the Miami Heat during the first quarter in Game Two of the 2023 NBA Finals at Ball Arena on June 04, 2023 in Denver, Colorado. 
				<p>The center position has historically played a vital role in basketball, with early NBA stars such as Bill Russell, George Mikan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar emerging from that position.</p>
<p>However, during the mid-2010s, a period arose where many analysts and fans believed that the center position&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, recent years have witnessed centers regaining the spotlight,&nbsp;&nbsp;NBA Most Valuable Player awards. Additionally, teams with size disadvantages are notably exploited in the postseason, further highlighting the renewed significance of the center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahead of the 2023-24 NBA season, here are the top five centers around the league who are expected to make significant contributions to their respective teams.</p>
<h3>5. Victor Wembanyama - San Antonio Spurs</h3>
<p>Despite not having played a single minute in the regular season yet, this year's number one overall draft pick has garnered immense hype for a reason - he is considered&nbsp;&nbsp;in the sport's history due to his unprecedented combination of size and skill.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old Frenchman&nbsp;&nbsp;during two of the Spurs' preseason games this past week, scoring efficiently and providing an intimidating defensive presence inside during his first taste of NBA action against the Thunder and Heat.</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 salary:&nbsp;</strong>$12,160,632&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Domantas Sabonis - Sacramento Kings</h3>
<p>The 27-year-old Lithuanian had his breakout year last season despite previously having made the All-Star team twice.</p>
<p>Sabonis helped the Kings clinch their first playoff appearance since 2006, and he was named to his third All-Star game and his first All-NBA selection, being named in the Third Team.</p>
<p>He&nbsp;, averaging 12.3 boards per game, although his postseason performances left much to be desired.</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 stats:&nbsp;</strong>19.1 PPG, 12.3 RPG, 7.3 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.5 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:&nbsp;</strong>$30,600,000</p>
<h3>3. Bam Adebayo - Miami Heat</h3>
<p>The 26-year-old center out of Kentucky provided another solid season for Miami, averaging a career-high 20.4 points. He helped the team reach the NBA Finals for the second time in the past four seasons with his consistent inside presence.</p>
<p>Adebayo&nbsp;&nbsp;his second All-Star team and fourth All-Defensive Second Team in a row.</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 stats:&nbsp;</strong>20.4 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 3.2 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.8 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:</strong>&nbsp;$32,600,060&nbsp;</p>

<h3>2. Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The 29-year-old finally&nbsp;&nbsp;NBA Most Valuable Player award last season by averaging a career-high 33.1 points per game en route to his second scoring title in a row.</p>
<p>Embiid also put up career-best averages in assists, field goal percentage, and minutes per game in a monster season.</p>
<p>However, he failed to reach the Eastern Conference Finals, losing a decisive Game 7 against the Celtics in the East Semis&nbsp;.</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 stats:&nbsp;</strong>33.1 PPG, 10.2 RPG, 4.2 APG, 1.0 SPG, 1.7 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:</strong>&nbsp;$47,607,350&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Nikola Jokic - Denver Nuggets</h3>
<p>The 28-year-old entered the pantheon of the game's all-time greats after a masterful postseason, leading the Denver Nuggets&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Coming off two NBA MVP-winning seasons, Jokic's dominance was evident throughout the year,&nbsp;&nbsp;during the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Serbian star solidified his position as the undisputed top center in the league, with the Finals MVP award as his crowning achievement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 stats:&nbsp;</strong>24.5 PPG, 11.8 RPG, 9.8 APG, 1.3 SPG, 0.7 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:&nbsp;</strong>$47,607,350&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
