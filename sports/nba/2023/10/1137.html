<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>One of the most hyped prospects of all time finally made his NBA debut.</p>
<p>Victor Wembanyama &nbsp;with the San Antonio Spurs during their season opener against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, October 25, at the Frost Bank Center in San Antonio.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old &nbsp;that made him the surefire top pick in this year's NBA Draft, putting up 15 points in 6-of-9 shooting and 3-of-5 from three-point range.</p>
<p>Wembanyama reflected on&nbsp;his first NBA game, appreciating the journey that got him in his place.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wemby on his debut: “Lots of emotions, of course. Would&#39;ve been perfect with a win. It felt surreal, for a moment. I just feel very lucky to be here.” </p>&mdash; Spurs Nation (@Spurs_Nation) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>"Lots of emotions, of course. Would've been perfect with a win. It felt surreal, for a moment. I just feel very lucky to be here," Wembanyama told reporters after the game.</p>
<p>The 7-foot-4 center added five rebounds, two assists, two steals, and one block in his widely anticipated first game, but the Spurs fell to the Mavericks, 126-119.</p>

<h2>Wembanyama's debut spoiled by foul trouble</h2>
<p>Despite the decent numbers, the Frenchman was marred by foul trouble, which allowed him to play in only 23 minutes.</p>
<p>He picked up two quick fouls in the first quarter and another pair to start the second half, severely limiting his game time.</p>
<p>Despite this, Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich praised Wembanyama .</p>
<p>"I think his maturity showed even at a young age. He came in for the last 7 minutes, and [he] just played. We ran some stuff for him, he executed," the five-time NBA champion coach said.</p>
