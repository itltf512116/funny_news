<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The Milwaukee Bucks showed how their two star players, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard, might perform together &nbsp;108-97 preseason victory against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, October 15.</p>
<p>Antetokoumpo remains unworried&nbsp;about establishing chemistry with his new teammate, expressing confidence that they will naturally develop it as they go along.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“It might take a month, 2 months, 6 months, it doesn’t matter. We might figure it out in the last game of the regular season… The goal is to be where we want to be when it matters the most.”<br><br>Giannis Antetokounmpo on playing with Damian Lillard.<br><br>(via ) </p>&mdash; ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) </blockquote>

<p>"It might take a month, two months, six months, it doesn't matter. We might figure it out in the last game of the regular season... The goal is to be where we want to be when it matters the most," the 2021 NBA Finals MVP said.</p>
<p>The Greek star &nbsp;about being consistently wide open for the first time in a while, highlighting that he had never witnessed someone being double-teamed right at the beginning of a game, as was the case with Lillard on Sunday.</p>

<h2>Lillard is also excited</h2>
<p>The seven-time All-Star is also thrilled about the opportunity to team up with someone as dominant as himself.</p>
<p>"Having another guy out there that's just dominant...First couple of plays, they blitz me, they trap me and the guy that I'm releasing the ball to is Giannis. So I'm just like, 'Uh, we can do this all night,'" the former Trail Blazer said.</p>
<p>Antetokounmpo showcased his typical dominant performance, tallying 16 points, eight rebounds, and two blocks on 7-for-10 shooting in a little over 15 minutes., resting in the entire second half.</p>
<p>Lillard contributed 14 points and three assists while going 6-for-6 from the free-throw line in 22 minutes, but he shot 3-of-10 from the field and 2-of-7 from three.</p>
