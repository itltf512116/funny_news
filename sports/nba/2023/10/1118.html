            <p>&nbsp;by a well-known rapper is one way to determine that an NBA player made it.</p>
<p>Stephen Curry has been mentioned in several songs by many rappers, but the music by upcoming rapper Sexyy Red hit different.</p>
<p>Female artist Sexyy Red dropped her song titled SkeeYee this year, featuring lyrics that are not meant for underage listeners.</p>
<p>Aside from&nbsp;, another way it stood out is its mention of Curry's name, even earning a reaction from the future Hall of Fame member himself.</p>
<p>"My sister in the backseat with a .30/ N****s tryna shoot they shot, Stephen Curry," she said in the song.</p>

<p>How does SkeeYee differ from other Steph Curry references?</p>
<p>The four-time NBA champ said hearing the song for the first time&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"When Sexxy Red did it, I just started laughing," he shared with Amber Corrine of&nbsp;<em>Vibe Magazine</em>.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I had never seen her at a basketball game."</p>
<p>Sexyy Red will probably feel elated that Curry knows she exists.</p>
<h2><strong>His favorite Curry namedrop</strong></h2>
<p>Curry is not keeping track of how many rappers used his name in their songs, but a teammate told him that the current count is around 160.</p>
<p>That is a lot to keep track of, but what is his favorite?</p>
<p>Grammy Award winner Drake's '0 to 100' song takes the bragging rights as Curry's favorite rap song reference.</p>
<p>"I started thinking about all the ones that I could remember and it's either a nickname, like Drake did with 'Chef Curry with the Pot,' or I think Future dropped one in the song 'Mad Max,'" he said.</p>
<p>"And it's funny to see how they rhyme it because either they do a nickname, the short name, they use number 30 or they just go with the whole full name and just try to write something."</p>
