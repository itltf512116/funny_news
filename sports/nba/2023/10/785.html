<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The Los Angeles Clippers have given controversial shooting guard Joshua Primo &nbsp;to play in the NBA.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old will be signing a two-way contract with the Clippers, according to&nbsp;league insider Adrian Wojnarowski of <em>ESPN</em>.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ESPN Sources: Free agent G Josh Primo is planning to sign a two-way contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. Since his release from the Spurs in October, Primo has been engaged in ongoing therapy – which will continue in LA. </p>&mdash; Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>Woj added that the 6-foot-6 underwent evaluation&nbsp;conducted by specialists who work with the team, and with the results, the organization expressed their comfort with providing Primo an opportunity.</p>
<p>Primo has also been actively participating in ongoing therapy, with plans for this therapy to continue in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The former Alabama player was released by the San Antonio Spurs in late October 2022, indicating that Primo was seeking mental health treatment for a "previous trauma" as the reason behind the decision.</p>
<p>The following day, reports emerged that Primo was allegedly involved in exposing himself to multiple women.</p>
<p>This led to the Spurs' sports psychologist taking legal action against both the player and the team, citing multiple instances of indecent exposure in the lawsuit.</p>

<h2>NBA suspends Joshua Primo</h2>
<p>A few hours before reports emerged that Primo would be signing for the Clippers, Friday, September 29, that they had suspended him for four games without pay due to conduct detrimental to the league.</p>
<p>The league conducted its investigation and sought expert input, confirming his actions. Primo claims his actions were unintentional, and the league found no evidence of other misconduct beyond the reported incident.</p>
