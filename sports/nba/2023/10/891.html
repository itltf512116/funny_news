					(Photo : Michael Reaves/Getty Images) MIAMI, FLORIDA - Payton Pritchard (#11) of the Boston Celtics dribbles against the Miami Heat in Game Two of the 2022 NBA Playoffs Eastern Conference Finals at FTX Arena on May 19, 2022 in Miami, Florida. 
				<p>Boston Celtics reserve guard Payton Pritchard had a day to remember on Sunday, October 8.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;fresh four-year contract extension with the 17-time NBA champions worth $30 million, months&nbsp;&nbsp;due to his reduced role in the team.</p>
<p>"It feels really good. Just to be secure, lock it in, and be a part of a great organization, a great city. Obviously, I think this is the best basketball organization and city in the NBA," Pritchard said ahead of their first preseason game on the same day.</p>
<p>While the former Oregon Ducks player was a regular rotation player for the Celtics during their NBA Finals run in the 2021-22 season, he saw reduced playing time and was relegated to a reserve role, including garbage time minutes, in the previous season.</p>
<p>He averaged a career-low 13.4 minutes per game in 2022-23,&nbsp;&nbsp;to the increased roles of players like Marcus Smart, Derrick White, and Malcolm Brogdon.</p>
<p>With the departure of Smart and Brogdon, Pritchard is expected to assume a bigger role in the upcoming season, and the new deal signifies the franchise's trust in him.</p>

<h2>Huge preseason game for Pritchard</h2>
<p>Hours after the new deal was confirmed, Pritchard&nbsp;&nbsp;as the Celtics came up with a 102-101 preseason win over the Philadelphia 76ers at the TD Garden.</p>
<p>Pritchard scored 26 points as he shot 9 for 14 from the field, including 6 for 11 from beyond the arc, and contributed four assists in just 23 minutes on the court.&nbsp;</p>
