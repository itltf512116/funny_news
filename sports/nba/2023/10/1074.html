					(Photo : Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images) PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA - Assistant coach Becky Hammon (L) and head coach Gregg Popovich (R) of the San Antonio Spurs react during the second quarter against the Philadelphia 76ers at Wells Fargo Center on January 07, 2022 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
				



            <p>San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich made it no secret to express his interest in the 2023 WNBA Finals.</p>
<p>The five-time NBA champion coach&nbsp;&nbsp;getting ejected during the Spurs' preseason game against the Houston Rockets just to witness the Las Vegas Aces' championship-clinching moment in Game 4 of the WNBA Finals on Wednesday, October 18.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I thought about getting booted tonight because [Game 4] was exactly the same time [as the Spurs' preseason game], but I just thought this has to be my priority," the 74-year-old tactician said, adding that he needed to get some wine to celebrate Las Vegas' victory.</p>
<p>The Aces&nbsp;&nbsp;WNBA title in a row, capping off a highly dominant season despite missing two starters - point guard Chelsea Gray and center Kiah Stokes in Game 4.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Spurs also secured a victory over the Rockets, scoring 117-103 in their fourth preseason game.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Aces head coach is former Spurs assistant</h2>
<p>Part of Popovich's enthusiasm to watch the game was because of Aces head coach Becky Hammon, who&nbsp;&nbsp;assistant coach for the Spurs from 2014 to 2022 before taking on the WNBA gig.</p>
<p>"It was close. Congrats, Becky. Yeah, baby! Good stuff," the three-time NBA Coach of the Year added.</p>
<p>Hammon&nbsp;&nbsp;as the first female acting head coach in NBA history after stepping in when Popovich was ejected during the second quarter of the Spurs' 121-107 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on December 30, 2020.</p>
