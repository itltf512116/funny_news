<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?-->Frank Vogel has coached the Los Angeles Lakers and Lebron James before. Despite that, the hype surrounding his new team, Phoenix Suns, feels different for him.</p>
<p>The Suns are regarded as a superteam after acquiring three-time All-Star &nbsp;to play alongside Kevin Durant and NBA executives' #1 shooting guard&nbsp;of the 2023 season, Devin Booker.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Frank Vogel on how excited Suns fans are: “Very few teams that I’ve been a part of have the type of buzz around the city about our team than what we experienced today, and that I’ve experienced since I got here, honestly.” </p>&mdash; PHNX Suns (@PHNX_Suns) </blockquote>

</center>

<p>Vogel knows the pressure is immense and acknowledges the huge support&nbsp;and excitement fans are showing.</p>
<p>"I would say that very few teams I've been a part of have the type of buzz around the city about our team than we experienced today," Vogel told reporters.</p>
<p>"I think they really believe in what we have here and we're going to pour everything we got to get this done."</p>
<p>The Suns have been in title contention in the past two seasons, but they came up short in the last two.</p>
<p>They are now hoping to go all the way to the top with KD, Booker, and Beal in tow.</p>
<h2><strong>Vogel gives credit to Matt Ishbia</strong></h2>
<p>New majority owner Matt Ishbia has been breaking the bank to invest in the Phoenix Suns, but it is not just his pocket used to support the club.</p>
<p>For Vogel, &nbsp;brings more energy to the organization.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of owners that have the willingness to spend but the energy he brings to our organization is infectious," he said.</p>
<p>"It is consistent with how to approach things as a head coach."</p>
