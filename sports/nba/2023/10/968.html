<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Philadephia 76ers guard James Harden opened up&nbsp;about his relationship with the team's President of Basketball Operations, Daryl Morey.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"> PG James Harden said he had a relation with the front office (not referring Daryl Morey by name) for 10 years. Asked if he thinks it can repaired, Harden said, “No.” Then he explains why: </p>&mdash; Keith Pompey (@PompeyOnSixers) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>Their association, which originated at the Houston Rockets, has spanned over a decade. However, their rapport is currently non-existent.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old opted not to address Morey by name, instead referring to him as "the front office," sharing that he had a good relationship with the executive for the past ten years, but it's now down the drain.</p>
<p>"This is not even about this situation, this is in life. When you lose trust in someone, it's like a marriage. You lose trust in someone, you know what I mean? It's pretty simple," the 2018 NBA Most Valuable Player explained.</p>
<p>Harden also revealed that when he arrived in Philadelphia in 2022, &nbsp;end his career with the team. However, "the front office" didn't have that in their plans.</p>

<h2>Sixers prepared to punish Harden</h2>
<p>According to <em>ESPN</em>'s league insider Adrian Wojnarowski, &nbsp;the ten-time NBA All-Star if he chooses not to perform at the level necessary during the regular season.</p>
<p>Woj added that trade discussions for Harden are expected to take place at some point during this season. However, executing them during the preseason proves to be challenging.</p>
<p>The Sixers' trade possibilities will likely expand when players signed in the offseason become eligible for trade starting on December 15.</p>
