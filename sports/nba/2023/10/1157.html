<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?-->Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo has been a source of wisdom ever since arriving in the NBA in 2013, but fans seem to be divided on his latest comments concerning his .</p>
<p>Before they made their 2023-2024 season debut against the Sixers, Giannis and Dame sat down with Chris Haynes of TNT, and there, the Greek Freak said Bucks is now his new partner's city.</p>
<p>"Basically, I might be here but this is his team," the two-time MVP said.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, for him to feel successful, [he's] got to feel very comfortable."</p>
<p>This comment usually gets a one-sided reaction, with Giannis being branded as humble and always having good insights into situations.</p>

<p>The reactions are different this time, with one commenter dragging the Bucks star, saying his constant appearance on media and social media .</p>
<p>To put into context, Pinkett Smith was recently the talk of the town for her divorce from Will Smith. Over the years, she has made what fans think are ridiculous, including about having an open relationship while still with Will Smith.</p>
<h2>What did fans think of Giannis and Dame relationship?</h2>
<p>Many received this latest "wisdom" from Giannis as something similar to the dynamic of Dwyane Wade and Lebron James during their Miami Heat stint when the former allowed the King to take over his franchise.</p>
<p>Others thought it is absurd, especially with the fact that Giannis has accomplished more than Dame.</p>
<p>"I love Giannis. My favorite player in the League right now but what? That was silly," one Facebook comment on <em>Bleacher Report</em>'s page said.</p>
<p>"With respect, this is Giannis team. 2x MVP, and Champ. He's being respectful, but he's clearly the better player," another user said.</p>
<p>X users&nbsp;found the statement ridiculous, too.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Giannis just be saying a bunch of words man. Lmao </p>&mdash; Hub (@KenHeLive) </blockquote>

<p>What do you think? Is Giannis humble or already overdoing it?</p>
