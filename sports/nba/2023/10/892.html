				<p>The Milwaukee Bucks made a significant splash with the offseason winding down, enhancing their roster by&nbsp;&nbsp;from the Portland Trail Blazers, a member of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team and one of the greatest point guards of all time.</p>
<p>This move immediately improved their odds of winning the 2024 NBA Championship, making them favorites&nbsp;, with odds at +350 on Bet365, +375 on BetMGM, and +400 on Caesar's Sportsbook.</p>
<p>However, despite the optimism stemming from this blockbuster trade, there are several factors beyond the acquisition to consider when assessing the Bucks' title chances.</p>
<p>Here are five reasons why the Bucks will not win the 2024 NBA Championship:</p>
<h3>1. Lack of Depth</h3>
<p>Even before acquiring Lillard, the Bucks already had concerns about their depth, and they traded away two key players, Jrue Holiday and Grayson Allen, as part of the deal.</p>
<p>The team has exploitable holes on the point guard and the power forward spot if their starters cannot play.</p>
<h3>2. Aging starters</h3>
<p>The Bucks'&nbsp;&nbsp;for the 2023-24 season comprises Damian Lillard, Khris Middleton, Jae Crowder, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Brook Lopez.</p>
<p>Notably, four of these players have already crossed the age of 30, with Middleton (32), Lillard (33), Crowder (33) and Lopez (35).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Antetokounmpo may be the youngest at 28, but his significant role in carrying the team could lead to higher wear and tear than his age might suggest.</p>
<p>Additionally, his playing style, characterized by athleticism and physicality, may not age gracefully.</p>
<p>They have accumulated extensive wear and tear from multiple deep playoff runs throughout their careers, making them susceptible to injuries.</p>
<h3>3. Recent injury history&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Middleton only appeared in 33 regular season games last season due to undergoing wrist surgery during the offseason in 2022, missing the first 20 games of the campaign.</p>
<p>Upon his return, the 6-foot-7 wing struggled with issues on his right knee, and he&nbsp;&nbsp;surgery last June.</p>
<p>Antetokounmpo&nbsp;&nbsp;with a minor knee cleanup surgery last summer, which caused him to miss the 2023 FIBA World Cup with Greece.</p>
<p>Lillard missed 24 games, including the final 10 games of 2022-23, due to a recurring calf strain, which could lead to worse injuries, such as an Achilles rupture, if not treated properly. An abdominal injury also forced the former Blazer to play only 29 games for the 2021-22 season.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4. The Celtics added Jrue Holiday</h3>
<p>Despite the Bucks' initial belief that they avoided trading their defensive stalwart, Jrue Holiday, to a rival team in the Eastern Conference by sending him out West, the Boston Celtics&nbsp;&nbsp;and secured the services of this highly-regarded guard.</p>
<p>The three-time All-NBA Defensive First Team member further boosts the Celtics roster and makes them an even more well-rounded team, which poses huge trouble for Milwaukee as they aim to make it out of the East.</p>
<h3>5. Giannis Antetokounmpo is exploitable in the playoffs.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Bucks' main man has a weakness that has been exploited throughout the years: his free throw and outside shooting.</p>
<p>The two-time MVP converted only 14 of his 31 free-throw attempts during their first-round loss against the Miami Heat last April. He has also&nbsp;&nbsp;for his free-throw routine at one point, which lasted more than the mandated 10 seconds.</p>
