<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?-->Some people just need a second chance.</p>
<p>Cleveland Cavaliers coach JB Bickerstaff can't help but feel great about the debut of Emoni Bates in a narrow loss to the Atlanta Hawks.</p>
<p>Bates, who was once projected to become a top pick in the NBA, played only in the second half but made the most out of the opportunity by making big plays one after the other despite the defeat.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Emoni Bates scored 10 pts in the 4th quarter including this go-ahead three in the waning moments. <br><br>They did lose the game, but this man is HIM. <br><br>Future is so bright<br><br> </p>&mdash; Across The Cavs (Offseason) (@AcrossCavs) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>The &nbsp;scored 10 points in the game; the best ones came from the dying moments when he hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 10.5 seconds left to give his team a two-point lead.</p>

<p>It was only a preseason game, but &nbsp;to declare that Bates could rise in the pro league.</p>
<p>"He is a really good basketball player," Bickerstaff said of his rookie.</p>
<p>"He has the ability to make open shots, but he also has the ability to create shots for himself. When you have a guy like that, that's been through the pressure that he's been through since he was 12 years old, that last shot meant nothing. He has seen way worse so to have the courage to create that shot (and) knock it down was big time. I think the best is yet to come."</p>
<h2><strong>Bates crawling his way back up</strong></h2>
<p>The 19-year-old was a top prospect in high school and college, prompting many sports shows to project him as a top draft in the NBA. However, his stock fell over time owing to his off-court troubles and back injury.</p>
<p>He showed promise during his time with Memphis Tigers as a 17-year-old college freshman but had to sit out most of the games due to a lower back injury.</p>
<p>He then transferred to East Michigan by his sophomore year, but his time there was hampered as he was , causing him to miss several games.</p>
