					(Photo : Octavio Passos/Getty Images) LISBON, PORTUGAL - Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal celebrates after scoring their sides first goal during the UEFA EURO 2024 qualifying round group J match between Portugal and Liechtenstein at Estadio Jose Alvalade on March 23, 2023 in Lisbon, Portugal.
				<p>Cristiano Ronaldo is considered one of the greatest football players of all time and one of the most famous athletes in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hailing from Madeira, Portugal, Ronaldo boasts a staggering career record of over 850 official goals,&nbsp;&nbsp;the all-time top scorer in senior professional football.</p>
<p>Ronaldo's five Ballon d'Or awards place him second on the list of most wins,&nbsp;&nbsp;world's most famous athlete, according to&nbsp;<em>ESPN</em>, from 2016 to 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The combination of his incredible skill on the field and handsome looks has created a massive commercial opportunity, and the all-time top scorer of Real Madrid capitalized on those factors to add numbers to his bank account.</p>
<p>With his success in a highly popular sport and beyond it, many are asking - How much is Cristiano Ronaldo's net worth in 2023?</p>
<h2>Cristiano Ronaldo's Net Worth 2023: $500 million</h2>
<p>The 38-year-old Ronaldo is worth a staggering $500 million, according to various sources such as&nbsp;,&nbsp;, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The four-time European Golden Boot winner&nbsp;&nbsp;by business magazine&nbsp;<em>Forbes&nbsp;</em>as the highest-paid athlete in the world for 2023, earning $136 million for the past year.</p>
<p>Most of the figure came from his numerous endorsements, netting him $90 million. Meanwhile, $46 million was from his salary from Manchester United and Al-Nassr.</p>
<p>The Portuguese star consistently secures a place among the highest-paid athletes globally and has never fallen below the top three spots on&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>' annual highest-paid athletes list since he placed second in 2014. Apart from this year, he also claimed the top position in 2016 and 2017.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cristiano Ronaldo's Wealth</h2>
<p>Ronaldo's wealth is expected to increase significantly in the coming years after he signed the second-largest deal in sports history in late 2022,&nbsp;&nbsp;to Saudi Professional League club Al-Nassr in a 2.5-year contract worth $214 million annually.</p>
<p>The former Manchester United forward is also the third athlete in history and the first in team sports to&nbsp;$1 billion in career earnings, achieving the milestone in June 2020.</p>
<p>Notably, Ronaldo's influence extends beyond the football pitch to his immense social media following, where he reigns as the most-followed individual on two major platforms: Instagram and Facebook.</p>
<p>He boasts over 600 million followers on Instagram and 160 million on Facebook. With this massive online audience,&nbsp;&nbsp;$3.2 million for each sponsored post he shares.</p>
<p>The current Al-Nassr star has had a longstanding sponsorship relationship with the American sportswear giant Nike since 2003.</p>
<p>This partnership was elevated to a new level in 2016 when Ronaldo became only the third athlete in Nike's history to secure a lifetime deal with the brand, joining the ranks of Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Under this agreement, Ronaldo earns $24 million annually to represent the iconic Swoosh logo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to his partnership with Nike, Ronaldo holds endorsement deals with various prominent brands, including mass media company Altice, cryptocurrency exchange Binance, online food delivery app Delivery Hero, dietary supplements seller Herbalife, collectibles company Panini, and wellness products manufacturer Therabody.&nbsp;</p>
