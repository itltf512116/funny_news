					(Photo : Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - Paul George (#13) and Kawhi Leonard (#2) of the LA Clippers in the third quarter at Crypto.com Arena on March 03, 2022 in Los Angeles, California.

				<p>A Kawhi Leonard-Paul George team-up can be as good as any duo in the NBA. However, this Los Angeles Clippers partnership is yet to yield results due to injuries each player suffered since teaming up in 2019.</p>
<p>Leonard and George are expected to play more games this season, but&nbsp;?</p>
<p>PG does not see their team among the NBA contenders season, and that is because they failed to present themselves as one in the past seasons.</p>

<p>"I can't really say we're overlooked. We haven't done nothing yet, so we're not the team to beat. We're not the best team out there, and we got a lot to prove," George said, per&nbsp;<em>ClutchPoints&nbsp;</em>Clippers beat reporter Tomer Azarly.</p>
<p>"We haven't answered all the questions we need to answer. For us, we just go out there and prove it now."</p>
<h2><strong>Tyronn Lue comments on PG-Kawhi availability</strong></h2>
<p>Clippers coach Tyronn Lue, for his part, will continue to rely on the prized duo in the upcoming season.</p>
<p>He believes Leonard and George are&nbsp;&nbsp;for the team's sake.</p>
<p>"Whatever I wanna do, they're gonna do it," Lue told reporters.</p>
<p>"They trust me. I've earned their trust over the last 3 years and whatever is best for the team, that's the move we're gonna make."</p>
<p>Lue started with the Clippers as an assistant coach and became a head coach by 2023. They have reached the playoffs in all seasons he was there despite missing one of, if not both, George and Kawhi.</p>
<p>So far, the&nbsp;&nbsp;in four seasons together.</p>
