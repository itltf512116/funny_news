					(Photo :  Eric Espada/Getty Images) MIAMI, FLORIDA - Bradley Beal (#3) of the Washington Wizards drives towards the basket while being defended by Tyler Herro (#14) of the Miami Heat during the second half at FTX Arena on November 25, 2022 in Miami, Florida. 
				<p>Three-time All-Star, one-time All-NBA Third Team - these are what Bradley Beal can bring to the table.</p>
<p>Who would not want a player of Beal's caliber? Apparently, the Miami Heat.</p>
<p>Reports have surfaced revealing that the Heat was offered the former Washington Wizards star, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;because of Beal's age.</p>
<p>The Heat would instead invest in its 2019 13th overall pick.</p>
<p>"From what I heard, the Heat looked at that situation and said, 'We don't think Bradley Beal, who's seven years older than Tyler Herro, is $30 million better than Tyler Herro going forward. We just don't think the upgrade is worth it," reporter Zach Lowe said.</p>

<p>The age might not be the only reason for the Heat's rejection of Beal.</p>
<p>Beal, who&nbsp;, signed a five-year, $251 million contract in 2022. Herro, on the other hand, is only in the first year of his $130 million rookie-scale extension.</p>
<h2>Tyler Herro glad he's still a Heat</h2>
<p>Many players will say that being pursued by other teams only means you are a capable player. However, Herro wants something different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His name was first attached to the Portland Trailblazers in exchange for Damian Lillard, who eventually was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks.</p>
<p>With the trade machine already off, the 23-year-old shooter aims to&nbsp;&nbsp;and have his name erased from trade rumors.</p>
<p>"Honestly, my goal this year is to get my name untouchable. That's my goal. At the end of this season, they won't want to trade me," Herro told the Miami Herald.</p>
