					(Photo : Ezra Shaw/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - LeBron James (#6) of the Los Angeles Lakers is guarded by Stephen Curry (#30) of the Golden State Warriors during the first quarter of game two of the Western Conference Semifinal Playoffs at Chase Center on May 04, 2023 in San Francisco, California.
				<p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) has the fourth-largest revenue of any sports league in the world, and they are projecting $5.7 billion in revenue for the upcoming 2023-24 season.</p>
<p>Despite holding the fourth position in revenue, the NBA stands out due to the limited roster spots available compared to other leagues.</p>
<p>Each NBA team can have a maximum of 15 players during the regular season, unlike the National Football League (NFL), with 53 players per team, and Major League Baseball (MLB), 40 players per team.</p>
<p>This unique roster size contributes to substantially higher player salaries in the NBA, as there are fewer players to divide the salary cap among, making NBA players&nbsp;&nbsp;in terms of average annual salary per player across all sports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, here are the ten highest-paid players in the NBA for the 2023-24 season, according to&nbsp;and&nbsp;.</p>
<h3>Tied-7. Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks) - $45,640,084&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The 2021 NBA Finals MVP will be eligible for another max extension next season, with the potential to earn even more in his upcoming deal.</p>
<h3>Tied-7. Paul George (Los Angeles Clippers) - $45,640,084&nbsp; &nbsp;</h3>
<p>George's contract is identical with co-Clippers star Kawhi Leonard, and both have a player option for the 2024-25 season worth $48,787,676.</p>
<h3>Tied-7. Kawhi Leonard (Los Angeles Clippers) - $45,640,084&nbsp; &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Like his Clippers co-star Paul George, Leonard is already in discussions with the team for a possible extension,&nbsp;&nbsp;the championship window with the two.</p>
<h3>Tied-7. Damian Lillard (Milwaukee Bucks) - $45,640,084&nbsp; &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Lillard is the first player in NBA history to breach the $60 million mark in terms of single-season salary, with his player option for the 2026-27 season worth $63.2 million.</p>
<h3>6. Kevin Durant (Phoenix Suns) - $46,407,433&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Suns star has the third-highest career earnings of any player in NBA history, making $350,297,591 throughout 16 seasons in the league.</p>

<h3>5. Bradley Beal (Phoenix Suns) - $46,741,590&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Aside from signing one of the largest contracts in NBA history, Beal's contract is&nbsp;with a no-trade clause in the entire league.</p>
<h3>Tied-2. Joel Emiid (Philadelphia 76ers) - $47,607,350&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The reigning NBA MVP signed a four-year max extension with Philadelphia worth $196 million, which will begin to take effect this season.</p>
<h3>Tied-2. - Nikola Jokic (Denver Nuggets) - $47,607,350&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The reigning NBA Finals MVP previously&nbsp;&nbsp;in NBA history in terms of total value, signing a five-year extension worth over $264 million in the summer of 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tied-2. - LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers) - $47,607,350</h3>
<p>The league's all-time leading scorer also holds the career record for most earnings by a wide margin, having collected $434,986,078 in NBA salary from 2003-04 to 2022-23.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors) - $51,915,615&nbsp;</h3>
<p>For the seventh straight season, the greatest three-point shooter of all time is the highest-paid player in the league, having held the distinction since the 2017-18 season.&nbsp;to sign a contract worth $200 million twice.</p>
