					(Photo : Ronald Cortes/Getty Images) SAN ANTONIO, TX - Victor Wembanyama (#1) of the San Antonio Spurs poses for photographs during San Antonio Media Day at 21 Spurs Lane on October 2, 2023 in San Antonio, Texas. 
				<p>Victor Wembanyama&nbsp;&nbsp;in NBA history, with his arrival in the league having been anticipated for over a year while he played in France's LNB Pro A.</p>
<p>At 19, he boasts an extraordinary blend of a 7-foot-4 stature and shooting and ball-handling skills reminiscent of a guard.</p>
<p>This exceptional combination has left numerous observers in awe, with some boldly forecasting that this year's top overall pick will become one of the game's all-time greats. The French prodigy finds himself in an advantageous position,&nbsp;&nbsp;of the San Antonio Spurs.</p>
<p>The team's track record of nurturing talent, especially those from foreign countries, suggests that the Frenchman is in capable hands, particularly under the guidance of head coach Gregg Popovich as he embarks on the early years of his career.</p>
<p>As his highly anticipated debut season approaches in just a few weeks, here are five bold predictions for Victor Wembanyama for the 2023-24 season.</p>
<h3>1. Wembanyana will struggle in his first few games.</h3>
<p>Remember the Frenchman's first NBA Summer League Game back in July,&nbsp;&nbsp;nine points on 2-of-13 shooting, adding eight rebounds, three assists, and five blocks in a fair effort?</p>
<p>That might be the case for Wembanyama's first few games in the regular season as he continues to get used to real NBA action while facing the scrutiny of the defense.</p>
<h3>2. The San Antonio Spurs will not be good, but they will be fun to watch.</h3>
<p>The Spurs&nbsp;&nbsp;in the league. Aside from Wembanyama, the team also has guard Devin Vassell, wing Keldon Johnson, and forward Jeremy Sochan.</p>
<p>This dynamic mix of talent could make the team a must-watch, even though they are not necessarily expected to secure many victories.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>3. Wembanyama's game will translate well in the NBA.</h3>
<p>Wembanyama's game is expected to translate effectively to the NBA due to his unique blend of elite shooting and size, making him unguardable in the modern NBA landscape.</p>
<p>Aside from his scoring ability, his imposing frame makes him an elite shot-blocker, and&nbsp;&nbsp;for most blocks in LNB Pro A this year.</p>
<h3>4. Wembanyana will miss a significant number of games due to load management.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Wembanyama might undergo the infamous "load management" practice in his rookie season for a seamless transition in the league since the Spurs aren't exactly fighting for a championship.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Spurs might consider pursuing another high draft pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, which would allow them to acquire a strong complement to their top prospect.</p>
<h3>5. Wembanyana will still win the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The 2023 NBA Draft class is deep, with many notable talents such as Scoot Henderson, Brandon Miller, the Thompson twins, and Chet Holmgren, who will make his debut season.</p>
<p>Cam Whitmore, Gradey Dick, and Taylor Hendricks could even emerge as potential dark horses in the Rookie of the Year race, but ultimately Wembanyama would be too good to lose out on the league's top rookie honor, barring any unfortunate injuries.</p>
