					<img title="Devin Booker and Zach LaVine - Phoenix Suns v Chicago Bulls" src="/upload/images/2023/10/23/2c0e92fed582fb1b.jpg" alt="Devin Booker and Zach LaVine - Phoenix Suns v Chicago Bulls" />
					(Photo : Stacy Revere/Getty Images) CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - Devin Booker (#1) of the Phoenix Suns is defended by Zach LaVine (#8) of the Chicago Bulls during a game at United Center on February 07, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois. The Suns defeated the Bulls 127-124. 
				



            <p>The NBA is full of talented shooting guards, featuring exceptional scorers and top-tier two-way players who command attention from the defense and take the spotlight on the offense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the 2023-24 NBA season opens on Tuesday, October 24, here are the top five shooting guards across the league expected to make dazzling plays and help their teams pick up victories.</p>
<h3>1. Zach LaVine - Chicago Bulls</h3>
<p>LaViner&nbsp;&nbsp;in 2022-23 compared to the prior year, where he made the All-Star game due to a slow start&nbsp;following a&nbsp;left knee surgery in the offseason.</p>
<p>Despite missing out on accolades, the 28-year-old's numbers remained steady from his 2021-22 campaign.</p>
<p>On top of that, he remained healthy, playing in 77 out of the Bulls' 82 regular season, although they were defeated in the play-in tournament by the 2023 NBA Finals runner-up Miami Heat.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 Stats:&nbsp;</strong>24.8 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 4.2 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.2 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:</strong>&nbsp;$40,064,220</p>
<h3>2. Jaylen Brown - Boston Celtics</h3>
<p>Following his second All-Star appearance and first All-NBA selection with the Second Team, the 26-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;largest contract in NBA history, worth $304 million over five years.</p>
<p>Brown averaged career-highs in points, rebounds, assists, field goal percentage, free throw percentage, and minutes in a solid 2022-23 campaign.</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 stats:&nbsp;</strong>26.6 PPG, 6.9 RPG, 3.5 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.4 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:</strong>&nbsp;$31,830,357&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Donovan Mitchell - Cleveland Cavaliers</h3>
<p>Mitchell, 27, has grown into one of the most consistent players in the league, making the last four NBA All-Star Games.</p>
<p>In his first season with the Cavaliers, Mitchell was recognized with his first All-NBA selection, making it to the Second Team. He posted a career-high average of 28.3 points per game,&nbsp;&nbsp;71-point game output.</p>
<p>Mitchell was instrumental in guiding Cleveland to their first playoff appearance since LeBron James left the team in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 stats:&nbsp;</strong>28.3 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 4.4 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.4 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:</strong>&nbsp;$33,162,030&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4. Anthony Edwards - Minnesota Timberwolves</h3>
<p>The 22-year-old former first overall pick is poised for a breakout season&nbsp;&nbsp;Team USA in the 2023 FIBA World Cup despite their disappointing fourth-place finish.</p>
<p>Edwards was named to his first-ever All-Star game last season, averaging career highs in all facets of his game except free-throw shooting percentage.</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 stats:&nbsp;</strong>24.6 PPG, 5.8 RPG, 4.4 APG, 1.6 SPG, 0.7 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:</strong>&nbsp;$13,534,817</p>
<h3>5. Devin Booker - Phoenix Suns</h3>
<p>The 26-year-old Suns' star was unable to secure All-Star and All-NBA honors last season due to missing numerous games at the beginning of the 2022-23 season with a groin injury, despite being named to the All-NBA First team in the previous year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite this, Booker notably raised his performance level as the season progressed, delivering outstanding displays during the postseason.</p>
<p>This included&nbsp;&nbsp;playoff career-high with 47 points in the Western Conference Semifinals against the eventual NBA champions, the Denver Nuggets, even though they ultimately lost the series in six games.</p>
<p><strong>2022-23 stats:&nbsp;</strong>27.8 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 5.5 APG, 1.0 SPG, 0.3 BPG&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023-24 Salary:</strong>&nbsp;$36,016,200&nbsp;</p>
