<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The Phoenix Suns are &nbsp;in preparation for their opening night match against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday, October 24, at the Chase Center in San Francisco.</p>
<p>As part of their efforts to streamline the roster, the Suns have decided&nbsp;to release guard Keon Johnson, bringing their roster to 15 players ahead of the start of the season.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Phoenix Suns are planning to waive guard Keon Johnson to get the roster to 15 for opening night, sources tell ESPN. Johnson, 21, landed with Phoenix from Portland as part of the three-team trade with Milwaukee. He was the 21st overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft.</p>&mdash; Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) </blockquote>

<p>Phoenix acquired the 21-year-old former first-round pick from the Portland Trail Blazers in a multi-team blockbuster trade that also involved the acquisition of former Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic and wing Nassir Little.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Suns acquired former Milwaukee Bucks guard Grayson Allen as part of the same deal. This trade notably included the move of star point guard Damian Lillard to the Bucks and Deandre Ayton to the Blazers.</p>
<p>Johnson was selected as the 21st overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft by the New York Knicks before being traded to the Los Angeles Clippers, where he spent half of his rookie season. Six months later, the former Tennessee Volunteers player was dealt to Portland.</p>

<h2>Suns keep fan favorite Bol Bol</h2>
<p>With the decision to cut Johnson, the Suns &nbsp;Bol Bol to remain in the squad and occupy the remaining roster spots. The lanky 7-foot-3 fan-favorite center spent the 2022-23 season with the Orlando Magic.</p>
<p>In addition, former Warriors guard Damion Lee, who won a title with the Dubs in 2022, is safe from being released.</p>
