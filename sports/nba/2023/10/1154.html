            <p>The Sacramento Kings won in a dominating fashion against the Utah Jazz in their NBA 2023-2024 season debut, but that is far from the concern of head coach Mike Brown.</p>
<p>America was shocked for the nth time by a mass shooting that killed at least 16 people and wounded several others.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;but is still at large.</p>
<p>What would've been a celebration of the return of the world's top basketball game turned into a nightmare because of the incident.</p>

<p>Brown felt exhausted after the game, not because of basketball but because of the state of America and its gun violence.</p>
<p>"It's sad that we sit here and watch this happen time, after time, after time, after time, and nobody does anything about it," Brown told reporters. "It's a sad day."</p>
<p>Gun Violence Archive has listed 487 mass shootings in the United States. At least 571 people have been killed, and 1,947 were injured.</p>
<h2>NBA coaches have been vocal about gun violence</h2>
<p>Brown is not the first NBA coach to use his platform to call for greater protection of citizens amidst the almost daily occurrences of mass shootings in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hall of Fame coach Gregg Popovic of the San Antonio Spurs in April called out the government for not acting on the root cause of the violence.</p>
<p>He is also worried about his grandchildren, whom he drops off at school, as they might become victims of shooting, too.</p>
<p>Popovich's former assistant and Golden State Warriors coach, Steve Kerr, was also very vocal about his stance on the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a passionate plea, he&nbsp;&nbsp;as the root cause of the senseless killings.</p>
<p>"I can't emphasize this enough: If we're going to move forward with Brady's plan for gun safety reform, we need to join forces to overcome Mitch McConnell and the NRA's dangerous inaction. Together we're unstoppable, and I hope you'll join me in this fight to take action on gun violence."</p>
