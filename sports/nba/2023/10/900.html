					(Photo : Candice Ward/Getty Images) LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - Kai Jones (#23) of the Charlotte Hornets celebrates with the bench after scoring against the San Antonio Spurs during the third quarter at the Thomas & Mack Center on July 07, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
				<p>Trouble Charlotte Hornets center Kai Jones probably needs to get off social media for a while after another act that could affect his NBA career negatively.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old has already been isolated by his teammates this summer for&nbsp;, including saying he is better than All-Star teammate LaMelo Ball and 2023 no. 2 draft pick Brandon Miller.</p>

<p>In another bizarre moment, Jones announced on the social media app X that he had requested a trade.</p>
<p>"I have officially requested to be traded from the Charlotte Hornets. #GOATLIFE," he wrote.</p>
<p>The Hornets organization&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning Jones' tweet after being reached by&nbsp;<em>The Observer</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>More fine/suspension for Kai</h2>
<p>The league prohibits such a move on social media, and it will not be a surprise if Jones gets subjected to more fines or suspension.</p>
<p>Right now, he is already out indefinitely, according to the Hornets.</p>
<p>League rules say:</p>
<p>"Any player (or, for clarity, any player representative or person acting with authority on behalf of a player) who publicly expresses a desire to be traded to another Team shall be subject to a fine and/or a suspension. The maximum fine that may be imposed by the NBA on a player pursuant to the foregoing shall be $150,000."</p>
<p>Jones has been the odd man out for the Charlotte organization, with his teammates unfollowing him on social media apps.</p>
<p>Hornets earlier announced that he will be&nbsp;, and it is not known whether he will be in the lineup come the opening week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jones is a third-stringer who averaged 3.4 points per game and 2.7 rebounds last season.&nbsp;</p>
