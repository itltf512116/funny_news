				<p>Portland Trail Blazers center Deandre Ayton&nbsp;&nbsp;Footprint Center for the first time since being traded away from the Phoenix Suns.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old's departure was part of a significant blockbuster trade that occurred last month, involving the move of point guard Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bahamian big man was putting up shots in the familiar playing venue on Monday, October 16, ahead of the preseason clash between the Suns and Trail Blazers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;his former team, Ayton appreciated the Suns for trading him to a team where he could feel valued and recognized.</p>
<p>"They didn't just throw me anywhere. They threw me where guys are my age and learning good basketball and starting something new. It could've been worse. I really got blessed to be a part of an organization that really valued me." Ayton said.</p>

<h2>Deandre Ayton displays no emotion</h2>
<p>In his return to Phoenix, Ayton emphasized his focus, saying, "I don't feel anything. I'm about to go play against the Phoenix Suns."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrary to his comment, Ayton&nbsp;&nbsp;the preseason game as he was given a rest, as confirmed by Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite his indifference, the former first overall pick of the 2018 NBA Draft reflected on his time with his former team, acknowledging the invaluable experiences he gained, particularly in understanding the process of achieving success and building team unity.</p>
