					(Photo : Carmen Mandato/Getty Images) HOUSTON, TEXAS - Kevin Porter Jr. (#3) of the Houston Rockets drives ahead of Jaylen Brown (#7) of the Boston Celtics during the first half at Toyota Center on March 13, 2023 in Houston, Texas. 
				<p>NBA fans have written off Kevin Porter Jr. after he was traded by the Houston Rockets to the Oklahoma City Thunder following his legal issues. Many think he will become unemployable with the controversies surrounding him.</p>
<p>These detractors might want to slow down in casting the stone as the 23-year-old point guard's girlfriend has come out to&nbsp;&nbsp;of domestic violence thrown at her ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>Porter's ex-girlfriend, former WNBA player Kysre Gondrezick, denied that Porter Jr. strangled her during an altercation and even went as far as saying that they only had a verbal exchange that lasted only 10 seconds.</p>
<p>"My injuries don't support any of those claims," Gondrezick said in an exclusive interview with the&nbsp;<em>New York Post</em>.</p>

<p>"He didn't hit me. He never balled his fists up and hit me. And he definitely didn't punch me in the face numerous times. That is a lie. I don't have any injuries to support that."</p>
<p>How did such fake news spread? Gondrezick has the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and cops to blame for the inaccuracies, saying the authorities did not interview her.</p>
<p>The news of KPJ's&nbsp;&nbsp;first came out last month. He was arrested in New York and was released on $75,000 bail.</p>
<h2>Porter Jr's NBA career in limbo</h2>
<p>KPJ has a history of legal troubles, but the September incident had a massive negative effect on his basketball career. On October media day, he was barred by the Rockets from joining the organization or interacting with anyone from the Rockets.</p>
<p>Right now, he is without a team after being traded to the Thunder and&nbsp;. Thunder will still have to pay him the $16.9 million remainder of his salary as part of his four-year partially guaranteed $82.5 million deal from the Rockets.</p>
