					(Photo : Megan Briggs/Getty Images) MIAMI, FLORIDA - The Denver Nuggets celebrate after a 108-95 victory against the Miami Heat in Game Four of the 2023 NBA Finals at Kaseya Center on June 09, 2023 in Miami, Florida. 
				<p>Denver Nuggets general manager Calvin Booth&nbsp;&nbsp;regarding his controversial remarks regarding several players.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old former player has been embroiled in controversy&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning starting small forward Michael Porter Jr. and former player Bones Hyland.</p>
<p>"Under no circumstances would I make or approve of those kind of comments for public consumption. It's not my character as a person or executive, and I think it's an unfair characterization of Michael and Bones," the general manager said.</p>
<p>Booth expressed his admiration for Hyland, acknowledging the young player's remarkable potential and charismatic presence on the court.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he emphasized Porter Jr.'s crucial role in the team, praising his character and offensive and defensive capabilities.</p>
<p>The executive added that the public disclosure of those comments was unfair, and he hopes to avoid similar incidents.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Calvin Booth's comments</h2>
<p>The Nuggets GM called out the defensive prowess of Porter Jr. and Hyland in a recent interview with&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"I knew you couldn't have two guys that couldn't guard, and we couldn't have two guys that were young and kind of more 'me guys.' Mike makes $30 million. He's one of the best shooters in the NBA. So, Bones, there's no place for you," Booth mentioned in the interview.</p>
