				<p>"I do want him arrested."</p>
<p>These are the words of the person behind the arrest of free agent Antonio Brown.</p>
<p>That person was AB's ex-girlfriend, Wiltrice Jackson, and she wanted the wide receiver handcuffed for failing to pay child support for their daughter.</p>

<p>Brown was&nbsp;, Florida, on Sunday for missing child support, ordered by a judge last August.</p>
<p>"Because, right now, he's making a mockery out of the judge, out of everything, because he feels like he's untouchable," Jackson said.</p>
<p>The ex-girlfriend rued that Brown, 35, does not feel compelled to support their 15-year-old daughter, an aspiring track and field athlete. She added that the child is already getting interest from at least 80 schools.</p>
<h2>Brown previously dismissed judge's order</h2>
<p>A Miami-Dade County judge first&nbsp;&nbsp;the former Pittsburg Steelers star's arrest due to his failure to pay $15,000 in child support.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Brown took to social media to&nbsp;&nbsp;calling the judge's ruling fake news. He even went after the reporter who broke the news of an upcoming arrest.</p>
<p>"Fu** the b*tch ass reporter who ever wrote the story!" Brown wrote on X. "You Mf don't know shit about me ! Where I came from what I been through!!"</p>
<p>"Ryan Clark been a bitch in media say things then apologize next AB name drop we gone strike yo ass boy. Champ had me spare u last time we spin yo ass for confusion boy rap life."</p>
