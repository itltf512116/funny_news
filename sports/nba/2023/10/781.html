					(Photo : Steph Chambers/Getty Images) PORTLAND, OREGON - Damian Lillard (#0) of the Portland Trail Blazers reacts during the third quarter against the San Antonio Spurs at Moda Center on January 23, 2023 in Portland, Oregon. 
				<p>Damian Lillard,&nbsp;&nbsp;to the Milwaukee Bucks, revealed several shocking events before he departed from the Portland Trail Blazers&nbsp;&nbsp;conducted by Chris B. Haynes of&nbsp;<em>Bleacher Report</em>.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old braced for the possibility that he might not be dealt after no transaction was made by late August.</p>
<p>With this, he expressed that if a trade couldn't be arranged with the Heat, he would withdraw his trade request and continue playing for the Blazers.</p>
<p>However, Blazers General Manager Joe Cronin&nbsp;&nbsp;that there was no possibility of him returning to the team, to the shock of the franchise's all-time leading scorer.</p>
<p>Lillard confessed that he was disappointed in how the Trail Blazers handled his trade request.</p>
<p>"How this summer played out behind the scenes definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. But it doesn't change the amazing experiences I've had with the Trail Blazers and this city," the NBA 75th Anniversary Team member said.</p>

<h2>Heat: Blazers got too emotional</h2>
<p>The seven-time NBA All-Star shared that the last conversation between the Blazers and the Heat happened in July.</p>
<p>Miami had plans to arrange a face-to-face meeting in Las Vegas during the NBA Summer League to discuss potential trade scenarios. However, it did not come to fruition.</p>
<p>The Heat felt that they were never presented with a real opportunity to negotiate, and they claimed that Portland took Lillard's demand to go to South Beach personally.</p>
