					(Photo : Greg Fiume/Getty Images) BALTIMORE, MARYLAND - Manager Brandon Hyde (#18) of the Baltimore Orioles walks to the dugout after a pitching change against the Texas Rangers during the third inning in Game Two of the Division Series at Oriole Park at Camden Yards on October 08, 2023 in Baltimore, Maryland. 
				<p>The Baltimore Orioles' promising season came to a disappointing conclusion&nbsp;&nbsp;in the National League Division Series by the Texas Rangers.</p>
<p>In Game 3, the Rangers exhibited their dominance with a resounding 7-1 victory, marking the end of the Orioles' first playoff appearance since 2016.</p>
<p>Baltimore's elimination was ironic,&nbsp;&nbsp;from any team during the regular season. Yet, when playoffs arrived, they failed to secure a single victory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But with their unforgettable season a thing of the past, Orioles manager Brandon Hyde&nbsp;&nbsp;about whether he still considered the campaign a success despite their elimination occurring sooner than anticipated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How can I not? We won 101 games. We won the East. We defied the odds. No one gave us a chance. We played really well all season," the 50-year-old mentor proudly stated.</p>

<h2>Baltimore Orioles' remarkable 2023 season&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The Orioles entered the playoffs with high hopes, finishing the 2023 regular season with a 101-61 win-loss record, winning the American League East division for the first time since 2014.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they clinched the best record in the entire American League and the second-best across Major League Baseball.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It didn't end the way that we wanted, but it was a special season. It was fun, it was the most fun I've ever seen a team have. That first playoff game at Camden Yards was amazing," Orioles outfielder and 2023 MLB All-Star Austin Hays said.&nbsp;</p>
