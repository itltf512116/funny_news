<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>New Portland Trail Blazers acquisition Jrue Holiday &nbsp;to the Milwaukee Bucks fans as he embarks on a new chapter with his new team.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old combo guard took on the social media platform Instagram to convey his message&nbsp;to the team he was part of for three seasons.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jrue Holiday says goodbye to the Milwaukee Bucks on IG💚<br><br>&quot;Thank you fans!

<p>"Thank you fans! For those who know me best, they know we are all about family. Milwaukee - you welcomed me and my family into your city, into your homes, into your hearts," the two-time NBA All-Star said.</p>
<p>The former UCLA player is considered one of the league's best perimeter defenders. He has earned All-NBA Defensive Team honors in five of the last six seasons, with three First Team selections (2018, 2021, 2023) and two Second Team selections (2019, 2022).</p>
<p>"We will forever be champions together, and me and my family will forever be grateful and thankful. Until next time, thanks for everything!," the 2021 NBA champion concluded.</p>

<h2>Trail Blazers' asking price for Jrue Holiday, revealed</h2>
<p>Celtics beat writer Jared Weiss of <em>The Athletic</em>&nbsp;revealed the likely starting asking price that the Trail Blazers would want for the 2021 NBA Sportsmanship Award winner.</p>
<p>Weiss &nbsp;for acquiring Holiday is expected to be a minimum of two first-round picks, but several teams in the running have the resources and the determination to offer more than that.</p>
