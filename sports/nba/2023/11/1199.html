            <p>Legendary basketball coach Bob Knight has&nbsp;&nbsp;at the age of 83, his family announced.</p>
<p>Knight, hospitalized in April this year, established a basketball coaching career considered among the most colorful in the sport's history.</p>
<p>He was also a pioneer of the motion offense and reverse action that many professional teams employ today.</p>

<p>He led the Indiana Hoosiers into three national titles, including a season where they went undefeated. The latter is a feat that remains to be duplicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It is with heavy hearts that we share that Coach Bob Knight passed away at his home in Bloomington surrounded by his family," his family's statement read.</p>
<p>The family added, "We are grateful for all the thoughts and prayers, and appreciate the continued respect for our privacy as Coach requested a private family gathering, which is being honored."</p>
<h2>Tributes poured in for Knight</h2>
<p>Fans, players, and coaches offered condolences and tribute for the befallen coach.</p>
<p>Indiana Pacers coach Mike Woodson, a former Hoosiers player,&nbsp;&nbsp;for the career that he has today.</p>
<p>"I am so blessed that he saw something in me as a basketball player," he said. "He influenced my life in ways I could never repay. As he did with all of his players, he always challenged me to get the most out of myself as a player and, more importantly, as a person."</p>
<p>Knight's former college rival and Duke's legendary coach, Mike Krzyzewski, also&nbsp;&nbsp;to him by Knight.</p>
<p>"Coach Knight recruited me, mentored me, and had a profound impact on my career and in my life. This is a tremendous loss for our sport and our family is deeply saddened by his passing."</p>
