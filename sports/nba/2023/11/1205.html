<p>When asked, the 19-year-old took his time to think about his answer, nearly covering the entire duration of the video shared on the USC Men's Basketball's official X account, formerly Twitter.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">His answer is worth the wait 😂 </p>&mdash; USC Men&#39;s Basketball (@USC_Hoops) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>Bronny named his father, the Los Angeles Lakers star and the NBA's all-time leading scorer, as his favorite player of all time.</p>
<p>"I'll probably say, like, LeBron James, something like that," James said while bursting into laughter after.</p>

<h2>Bronny James doing well</h2>
<p>The incoming USC Trojans freshman &nbsp;after experiencing a sudden and alarming cardiac arrest during a team practice on July 24 caused by a congenital heart defect.</p>
<p>LeBron James shared that Bronny has begun his rehab process to get back on the basketball court for the 2023-24 season.</p>
<p>"The successful surgery that he had ... he's on the up and up. It's definitely a whirlwind and a lot of emotions for our family this summer, but the best thing we have is each other," LeBron said during the Lakers' Media Day on October 2.</p>
