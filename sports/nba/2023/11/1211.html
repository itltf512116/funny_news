<p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?-->The Boston Celtics showed no mercy on the Indiana Pacers in their first meeting of the season, , 155-104.</p>
<p>The Celts did not even play their starts in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Coach Joe Mazulla's squad, still undefeated at 4-0, are the favorites coming into the game, but point guard Jrue Holiday said they approach this game just like any other.</p>
<p><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;There&#39;s a maturity, a competitive nature, being able to lock into whoever you&#39;re playing against.&quot; <br><br>Jrue Holiday talks getting up for every game despite the matchup  </p>&mdash; Celtics on NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSCeltics) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>He explained that they only showed "maturity" against the Pacers, the type of maturity that is focused more on themselves than whoever they play against.</p>
<p>"There's a maturity, a competitive nature, being able to lock into whoever you're playing against," he told reporters. "I know that there's times where there's a lesser caliber team or how you look at the team on the stat sheet, you gonna be like 'alright this is gonna be easy night for us'."</p>

<p>He also explained how the team is growing in terms of their collective mentality.</p>
<p>"I think that is part of the of the mindset we're having is each team is different," he continued. "Each game is an NBA game so each player is an NBA player. Any night they can go and give you 40 or 50 points. I think as a team we have locked in to that mentality."</p>
<h2>Record-breaking night for the Celtics</h2>
<p>While the team tries to normalize their invincibility in each game, that victory is no ordinary feat. They have broken several records in the game, including the &nbsp;at 75 since the 1950-1951 season. They also scored their highest points output in one game since 1959.</p>
<p><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ POINTS!<br><br>That‚Äôs the second most the  have ever scored in a game, and the most since 1959. ü§Ø |  </p>&mdash; Basketball Reference (@bball_ref) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>Other record:</p>
<p><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the first time the Celtics have led by 35+ points in consecutive games in 25+ seasons*, per Elias.<br><br>*The NBA has been tracking play-by-play data since the 1996-1997 season.</p>&mdash; Celtics Stats (@celtics_stats) </blockquote>
