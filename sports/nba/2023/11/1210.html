<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Nikola Jokic is the barometer these days for big men in the NBA. Oklahoma City Thunder's Chat Holmgren got to measure himself against the Denver Nuggets MVP when they met in the first week of the new season.</p>
<p>The Joker and the Nuggets dominated the Thunder, with Chet Holmgren playing just a notch above average.</p>
<p>The No. 2 overall pick of 2022 still managed to get the attention of the two-time MVP and even got praised for having the talent despite still learning the ropes in the league.</p>
<p>However, Jokic said that there's one thing Chet needs to do - and that is . It should be noted, though, that Holmgren, as center, plays differently from Jokic, who dominates each possession.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nikola Jokic says Thunder rookie Chet Holmgren needs to get ‚Äúfatter‚Äù üòÇ<br><br>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a really talented guy, but this is his first year.

<p>"He's a really talented guy, but this is his first year. He's still learning everything," per Jokic to <em>Denver Post</em>&nbsp;writer Bennett Durando.</p>
<p>"I think he needs to be a little bit fatter, to be honest. But yes, he has a talent that is unique."</p>
<p>Currently, &nbsp;outweigh Holmgren's 94 kilos.</p>
<h2>Holmgren's clapback at Jokic</h2>
<p>It took a few days, but the 21-year-old rookie, who sat out last season due to injury, &nbsp;to the advice of Jokic.</p>
<p>"It's hard to get fatter when you're not fat," he told reporters after their win over the Detroit Pistons last night.</p>
<p>"Start somewhere, I guess."</p>
<p>Holmgren filled the stat sheet against the Pistons, scoring 14 points and blocking four shots.</p>
