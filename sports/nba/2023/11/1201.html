            <p>AJ Griffin only played 10 minutes for the Atlanta Hawks against the Milwaukee Bucks, but he made every second count that he got a special mention from coach Quinn Snyder post-game.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;at Fiserv Forum, 127-110, to record their first win in three games after bowing to the Charlotte Hornets and the New York Knicks in their first two.</p>
<p>It was no ordinary game and win for AJ as it was against his father and rookie Milwaukee Bucks coach Adrian Griffin.</p>
<p>That relationship was put aside on Sunday night as AJ made sure to contribute to the victory by scoring six points in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Snyder thought AJ's performance&nbsp;&nbsp;when they needed it the most. He said having a player like AJ allowed them to make adjustments on the fly.</p>
<p>"We can put shooting on the court with AJ," the Hawks head coach said post-game.</p>
<p>"For a coach to be able to coach a team that is willing to accept those types of adjustments, whether it be a starter or someone finishing a game, it's a credit to AJ that we wanted to see him in there after the first half. We thought he could give us something and he did the right way."</p>
<h2>AJ can talk more trash against dad</h2>
<p>Coming into the game, Adrian Griffin shared about the dynamics between him and AJ and revealed that his son is the trash talker.</p>
<p>He said the Hawks guard&nbsp;&nbsp;when he hit a game-winner when Adrian was still part of the Toronto Raptors.</p>
<p>AJ sure got another one to throw at his father after this win.</p>
