            <p>Golden State Warriors point guard Chris Paul&nbsp;&nbsp;into his first experience of coming off the bench in his illustrious 18-season NBA career.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old was notably absent from the starting lineup for the Warriors' away game against the Houston Rockets on Sunday, October 29, at the Toyota Center.</p>
<p>This marked the end of an impressive streak of 1,365 consecutive games as a starter for Paul, dating back from his first game in the league, spanning both regular season and playoff games.</p>
<p>Despite his new role, Paul&nbsp;, citing the benefits it brings to the team.</p>
<p>"It works. It gives us a bigger lineup. I've never been on a team, probably with this type of depth. I've been on really good teams, don't get it twisted. But not necessarily where you could say: 'All these guys can start,'" the NBA 75th Anniversary Team member said.</p>

<h2>Chris Paul praises the Warriors' communication</h2>
<p>The twelve-time NBA All-Star&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriors' handling of the situation, noting that they didn't catch him off guard by placing him out of the starting lineup. Instead, they took the time to explain the decision to him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A lot of time people are scared to have those conversations. But you got guys who've won, guys who want to win and everyone understands what they mean to the team," the four-time All-NBA First Team added.</p>
