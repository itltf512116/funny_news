            <p>Jimmy Butler has proven time and again that he is the man if a comeback is needed but he was not there when the Miami Heat had to climb from a huge deficit against the Milwaukee Bucks.</p>
<p>Heat&nbsp;, 114-122. Butler scored 13 points in 29 minutes although did not play in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Fans were left confused by the benching of Butler. Head coach Erik Spoelstra&nbsp;&nbsp;saying he just did not feel the need to have him back after the reserves showed out.</p>
<p>"Our guys were changing the momentum," Spoelstra told reporters after the game when asked about Butler's lack of playing time.</p>

<p>"That sometimes can be frustrating when you're on the other side. They just want you to go away. Our guys were doing it with great energy and doing a lot of good things. Part of me also wanted to see if they could just continue to get it over the top."</p>
<p>The Heat reserves proved they deserve their playing time as they outscored the Bucks 41-25 in the fourth quarter. The lead was even down to six points with under 28 seconds left in the game.</p>
<p>A repeat of last season?</p>
<p>The Heat fell to 1-3 this season, something Heat fans have seen from last year.</p>
<p>They struggled during the regular season but charged their way to the NBA Finals eventually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;are the Indiana Pacers and the Charlotte Hornets.</p>
