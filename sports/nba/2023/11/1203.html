					(Photo : Elsa/Getty Images) NEW YORK, NEW YORK - Kristaps Porzingis (#8) of the Boston Celtics is greeted by teammates as he heads to the bench against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on October 25, 2023 in New York City. 
				



            <p>Derek Fisher was Kristaps&nbsp;, but their time together with the New York Knicks did not produce great results.</p>
<p>It has been eight years since the two worked together, and for Fisher, the Latvian center is&nbsp;&nbsp;where he can improve further.</p>
<p>"I'm happy for Kris that ... he's a part of such a great and well-run organization," Fisher told&nbsp;<em>Celtics Wire</em>.</p>

<p>"I think Brad Stevens is one of the greatest basketball people alive; how smart he is. Not just as a person but as a coach. And now, as an executive."</p>
<p>Fisher also gave props to Celtics coach Joe Mazulla, saying his mentality meshes well with Porzingis.</p>
<p>"I think Joe Mazzulla is the right type of coach and personality for Kristaps at this point in his career, and the team is about winning. And that's what Kris has always been about. So I'm just happy to see him now in a situation where all those things are, are aligned."</p>
<h2>Career season so far for Porzingis</h2>
<p>The Unicorn appears to be on his way to a career season with the Celtics.</p>
<p>Porzingis, acquired from the Washington Wizards during the summer, is&nbsp;&nbsp;in three games. He also recorded 8.5 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game in that span.</p>
<p>These numbers are higher than what he posted during his stint with other teams.</p>
<p>Barring any injuries, Porzingis could be on a breakout season.</p>
