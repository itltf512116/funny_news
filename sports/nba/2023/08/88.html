				<p>LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers is all set to play anew in the 2023-24 NBA wars, where he will be making $47.6 million. With that said, many are asking, how much is LeBron James' net worth in 2023?</p>
<p>His current salary is part of the two-year, $99 million&nbsp;&nbsp;he signed with the Purple and Gold last August 2022, per NBA.com. However, the second year of this pact is a player option. This means that if he chooses, the four-time NBA champion could forego the remaining $51.4 million in the second year with hopes of getting a bigger paycheck.</p>
<p>Regardless, James has been able to rack in his millions, and not all of them are purely from playing on the hardwood.</p>
<h2><strong>LeBron James Net Worth 2023: $1 Billion</strong></h2>
<p>The 18-time All-Star has been&nbsp;&nbsp;following another year of monster earnings amounting to $121.2 million before taxes and agents' fees, according to&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>.</p>

<p>Even more appalling is that the NBA star remains on active duty. Although injuries have hampered him in the past seasons, James remains a force to reckon with when he is healthy.</p>
<h2>LeBron James Edges Michael Jordan in Race to Billionaire Status</h2>
<p>Hence, James also became the first active NBA player to become a billionaire. The only other player who was able to do so was Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>However, the difference is that "His Airness" was able to tip the billionaire's list in 2014 - more than a decade since he retired for good.</p>
<p>James admits that it was one of the&nbsp;, being a billion-dollar athlete, when he talked to&nbsp;<em>GQ</em>&nbsp;in 2014.</p>
<p>"It's my biggest milestone," James said. "Obviously. I want to maximize my business. And if I happen to get it, if I happen to be a billion-dollar athlete, ho. Hip hip, hooray! Oh, my God, I'm gonna be excited."</p>
<p>Outside the court, the four-time NBA MVP also has a long&nbsp;&nbsp;deals. That list includes AT&amp;T, Crypto.com, GMC, Pepsi, Rimowa, and Walmart per Sportico.</p>
<p>He also signed a lifetime endorsement deal with Nike back in 2015. There was a time when he also served as a spokesperson for Blaze Pizza. Now, he owns a 10% stake in that company, adding another $30 million to his net worth.</p>
<h2>The King is Making Wise Investments as Well</h2>
<p>Beyond playing and endorsement deals, James also magnificently made the wise decision on where to invest his money. He owns a TV and movie production company called Springhill, something he started with business partner Maverick Carter in 2020.</p>
<p>This is the same company that produced "Space Jam 2," where James took on the lead role. Other shows that Springhill had included "The Shop: Uninterrupted," an HBO Max production that James occasionally hosts.</p>
<p>The production company is now&nbsp;&nbsp;$725 million, according to&nbsp;<em>CBS Sports</em>.</p>
<p>Other assets James has under his wing include three houses worth about $80 million. That includes a mansion he owns in Akron, Ohio, another in Beverly Hills, California, and another in Los Angeles.</p>
