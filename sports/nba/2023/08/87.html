					(Photo : Stacy Revere/Getty Images) MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN - Giannis Antetokounmpo (#34) of the Milwaukee Bucks dunks against the Philadelphia 76ers during the first half of a game at Fiserv Forum on April 02, 2023, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
				<p>Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo&nbsp;regarding his plans for his career.</p>
<p>In an interview with the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>, the two-time NBA MVP mentioned that&nbsp;&nbsp;to sign an extension with the Bucks this year.</p>
<p>The Greece international is eligible for a three-year, $173 million extension with the Bucks this September, but he can get a larger contract by signing an extension next offseason.</p>
<p>"The real question's not going to be this year - numbers-wise it doesn't make sense. But next year, next summer it would make more sense for both parties. Even then, I don't know," the 2021 NBA Finals MVP said.</p>
<p>Antetoukonmpo added that he needs to feel that everybody is on the same page with regard to their championship aspirations, with each one sacrificing time away from their family as he does.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old aims to play in the NBA for at least 20 seasons and as much as possible, all with the Bucks.</p>

<h2>Giannis Antetokounmpo prioritizes winning</h2>
<p>Despite wanting to remain in Milwaukee for the rest of his career, his staying&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucks being a championship-contending team.</p>
<p>"Winning a championship comes first. I don't want to be 20 years on the same team and don't win another championship," the seven-time All-Star said.</p>
<p>The Bucks finished the 2022-23 NBA season with the best record in the NBA at 58-24. However, they were upset by the 8th-seeded Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>The team fired head coach Mike Budenholzer and replaced him with Adrian Griffin.</p>
