					(Photo : Yong Teck Lim/Getty Images) BULACAN, PHILIPPINES - Karl-Anthony Towns (#32) of the Dominican Republic drives against AJ Edu (#34) of the Philippines in the third quarter during their FIBA World Cup Group A game at the Philippine Arena on August 25, 2023, in Bulacan, Philippines.
				<p>The FIBA World Cup 2023 is underway, and the host country's national squad got a dose of Karl Anthony-Towns on Friday, August 25, at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue Bulacan.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Timberwolves center was visibly trying to adjust to the international basketball brand of play. Regardless, this did not stop him from pouring in a game-high 26 points along with 10 rebounds for the Dominican Republic, who won over the Philippines, 87-81.</p>
<p>Making it harder for Towns was 6-foot-10 Filipino AJ Edu, the Filipino tasked to contain the three-time All-Star.</p>
<p>After their win, KAT&nbsp;, welcoming the challenge since it would help him become a better basketball player,&nbsp;<em>PTV Sports Philippines</em>&nbsp;reported.</p>
<p>"He's a fantastic player, he's an ultra competitor. I love the competition he brought tonight, it makes me better," the 27-year-old NBA star stated.</p>

<p>Aside from that, Towns also hailed the Filipinos for their culture and hard work - a reason why he was hardly surprised that the Philippines gave his team a scare for three-fourths of the game.</p>
<p>"You know, Filipinos are a culture that don't give up and they played hard, as I expect. The culture is nothing but a hard-working people," Towns quipped.</p>
<p>The Filipinos were in the thick of things&nbsp;, with Fil-American Jordan Clarkson and local behemoth June Mar Fajardo keeping the Dominican Republic at bay.</p>
<p>However, things swayed in favor of the Dominicans when the Utah Jazz star fouled out with still more than three minutes left in the contest in the Group A opener in front of a massive crowd of 38,115 spectators.</p>
