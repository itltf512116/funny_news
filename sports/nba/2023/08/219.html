					(Photo : Ezra Acayan/Getty Images) MANILA, PHILIPPINES - Austin Reaves (#15) of USA shoots a free throw during the FIBA Basketball World Cup Group C game between Greece and United States at Mall of Asia Arena on August 28, 2023 in Pasay, Metro Manila, Philippines.

<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The United States men's national basketball team is firing on all cylinders at the ongoing 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.</p>
<p>Team USA &nbsp;109-81 win against Greece, their second at the group stages on Monday, August 28, at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay, Philippines.</p>
<p>Lakers guard Austin Reaves was the man of the night, scoring a team-high 15 points on 4-of-7 shooting, 1-of-3 from three-point distance, and 6-of-6 from the free throw line. The 6-foot-5 undrafted player added 5 rebounds and 6 assists in the effort.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old made the FIBA World Cup record books with his outing, becoming the first&nbsp;Team USA player to have at least 15 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists in a World Cup game since Lakers teammate LeBron James did it thrice in the 2006 edition of the international tournament.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Austin Reaves joins LeBron James as the only Team USA players with at least 15 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists at the World Cup since 1994.   </p>&mdash; Raúl Barrigón (@BarriHoopsHype) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>Team USA has steamrolled two of its games in the tournament's group stages, claiming a lopsided win against New Zealand in their opening game last Saturday, August 26.</p>
<p>They are expected to top Group C regardless of whether they win or lose their final group stage game against Jordan on the morning of Wednesday, August 30.</p>

<h2>Austin Reaves is incredibly popular in the Philippines</h2>
<p>The undrafted 6-foot-5 guard had a breakout season in 2022-23, helping the Lakers make the Western Conference Finals after a 2-10 start, eliminating the defending champions Golden State Warriors in the second round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>Reaves played a big role for the purple and gold during those games, enabling him &nbsp;in the basketball-crazy nation.</p>
<p>Filipino fans have been cheering for Reaves whenever he touches the ball during Team USA games.</p>
