<p>The San Francisco 49ers are pulling the plug on former third overall pick Trey Lance, trading him&nbsp;to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a mid-round draft pick, according to NFL insider Adam Schefter of <em>ESPN</em>.</p>
<p><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trade: 49ers are sending their former No. 3 overall pick Trey Lance to the Dallas Cowboys for a mid-round, per sources. Lance now gets a fresh start in Dallas. </p>&mdash; Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>The exact compensation the Cowboys would be sending is a fourth-round draft pick, &nbsp;Tom Pelissero of <em>NFL Network.</em></p>
<p>The transaction comes a day after 49ers general manager John Lynch &nbsp;the 23-year-old quarterback is the most likely path for the team.</p>
<p>However, he did not dismiss the possibility of a trade, especially if it would benefit the team and Lance.</p>
<p>"If we can find a landing spot for Trey that is a really good one for him and works for our organization, that's not something that we'd turn a blind eye to," the 51-year-old executive said.</p>
<p>Lance was touted as the franchise's future star quarterback when the 49ers selected him with the third overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.</p>
<p>Since then, seventh-round pick Brock Purdy has taken that starting quarterback duties for San Francisco, while veteran Sam Darnold recently &nbsp;Lance for the backup spot, putting him as the third-string option.</p>

<h2>Fresh start for Lance in Dallas</h2>
<p>The former North Dakota State player &nbsp;to show his talent with the Cowboys.</p>
<p>Dak Prescott has been the longtime starting quarterback for the team, and it is unclear where he will be slotted among backups Cooper Rush and Will Grier.</p>
