					(Photo : Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images) PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA - Ben Simmons (#25) of the Philadelphia 76ers dunks during the first quarter against the Boston Celtics at Wells Fargo Center on January 22, 2021 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
				<p>Brooklyn Nets point guard Ben Simmons&nbsp;&nbsp;between him and the city of Philadelphia two years after he requested a trade from the Sixers, which started a standoff that lasted for several months.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old is open to playing for the 76ers for the second time if he ever gets traded, admitting that he had a lot of fun during his stint there.</p>
<p>"I'll always have love for Philly. People always ask me like, 'If you were to get traded again where you want it to be?' I always say, 'Just Philly. Philly is a second home to me,'" the three-time NBA All-Star said.</p>
<p>Simmons&nbsp;&nbsp;he has nothing bad to say about Philly, although he noted that what transpired was a crazy situation.</p>
<p>Simmons last appeared in a Sixers uniform during Game 7 of the 2021 Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Atlanta Hawks in June.</p>

<h2>Ben Simmons' goal for 2024</h2>
<p>The 2018 NBA Rookie of the Year was asked if he wanted to play for the Australian men's national basketball team for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France.</p>
<p>Simmons&nbsp;&nbsp;that it is something that he wants to do next year.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-10 has previously announced his willingness to play for Australia several times in the past, only to back out ahead of tournaments due to various reasons.</p>
