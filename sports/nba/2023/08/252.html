					(Photo : Takashi Aoyama/Getty Images) TOKYO, JAPAN - Nicolas Batum (#5) of France looks on during the international basketball game between France and Australia at Ariake Arena on August 20, 2023 in Tokyo, Japan.
				<p>The French men's national basketball team will leave the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup empty-handed.</p>
<p>Currently&nbsp;&nbsp;fifth-best national team in the world, France&nbsp;&nbsp;88-86 upset loss at the hands of Latvia on Sunday in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>
<p>The defeat officially eliminated Les Bleus from medal contention in the international tournament. They were previously decimated in their opener against Canada last Friday, 95-65.</p>
<p>France&nbsp;&nbsp;national teams in international basketball competitions for the past few years, finishing with a silver medal in the 2022 EuroBasket and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and a bronze in the previous edition of the FIBA World Cup in 2019.</p>
<p>France even defeated Team USA in their group stage game in the Olympics, while they only lost the gold medal by five points.</p>

<h2>Nicolas Batum was scared to go home due to shame</h2>
<p>Captain Nicolas Batum&nbsp;&nbsp;they disappointed many people with their worst-ever finish in FIBA World Cup history.</p>
<p>"I've never been ashamed with this jersey, but this is the first time I'm ashamed. I'm scared to go home because we let a lot of people down. A lot of people believed in us to do something special. We didn't do it," the Los Angeles Clippers forward said.</p>
<p>France will have a shot at redemption next year at the 2024 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Paris.</p>
