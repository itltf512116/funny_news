					(Photo :  Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images) PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA - James Harden (#1) of the Philadelphia 76ers dribbles against the Boston Celtics during the third quarter in game six of the Eastern Conference Semifinals in the 2023 NBA Playoffs at Wells Fargo Center.
				<p>The James Harden trade drama continues with the 2018 NBA MVP drawing a stiff $100,000 fine for ranting against Philadelphia 76ers top brass Daryl Morey.</p>
<p>And just when it appeared that the meted fine was laid out properly, the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) entered the picture.</p>
<p>The NBPA plans to&nbsp;&nbsp;to dispute the $100,000 fine handed by the NBA on James Harden for his public comments he made earlier this month while he was in China,&nbsp;<em>ESPN</em>&nbsp;reported.</p>
<p>"We respectfully disagree with the league's decision to discipline James Harden for recent comments he made, which we believe do not violate the rule against public trade demands," the NBPA said in a statement. "We intend to file a grievance and have the matter heard by our Arbitrator."</p>
<p>Hence, Harden will have to sit on pins and needles before settling down and determining where he will be playing next season.</p>

<h2>James Harden needs to start thinking maturely about his basketball career</h2>
<p>When asked to comment on the James Harden issue with the Sixers, veteran scribe and book author Roland Lazenby pointed out to this writer that the 10-time All-Star needs to stop acting like a prima donna and deal with the fact that Father Time is catching up with him.</p>
<p>"James Harden is that guy in American basketball known for dribbling by himself and attacking the basket and he can do it brilliantly. But he is starting to age. These guys... they are prima donnas...They age like everybody else," the 71-year-old journalist singled out.</p>
<p>"They don't handle the reality well. There are not a lot of teams who plan to pay James Harden a lot of money," he added.</p>
<p>Harden will turn 34 years old on August 26. While he signed a $35.6 million contract, it remains to be seen if "The Beard" can look forward to more huge paychecks once his beef with the Sixers is settled.</p>
