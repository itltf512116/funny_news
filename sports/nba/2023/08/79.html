					(Photo : Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - LeBron James (#6) of the Los Angeles Lakers celebrates with Magic Johnson after becoming the NBA's all-time leading scorer, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's career total of 38,387 points.
				<p>Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James remains one of the best players in the NBA to this day despite his age. Some christen him as the best player ever, considering he can play almost any position for any team.</p>
<p>Standing 6-foot-9, there is no doubt that the four-time NBA champion poses a matchup problem to any opposing team. This is a case that former NBA player Gilbert Arenas tried&nbsp;during the Gil's Arena show.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The 41-year-old went way back to the time of Norm Nixon and Earvin "Magic" Johnson to defend his stand. Arenas recalled when both players suited up for the purple and gold and how Johnson, standing at 6-foot-9 as well, went from being a forward to being the Lakers' playmaker.</p>

<p>"[Lakers] moved Norm [Nixon], they gave the ball to Magic because it was better played by a guy at that size... If you're gonna try to use Magic as the 'point guard' then you have to throw LeBron as the best PG," Arenas said when the Gil's Arena crew reignited the best point guard ever debate.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that James entered the league with freakish abilities, combining the talents of Johnson and Michael Jordan. But even more impressive is that despite being 38 years old, the four-time NBA MVP continues to be a force to reckon with inside the basketball court.</p>
<p>The discussion came to light after Golden State Warriors Stephen Curry&nbsp;&nbsp;about him being one of the game's best playmakers today.</p>
<p>"I really feel like - to your point, Magic's resume is ridiculous. The fact that we're even having that conversation is a place I never thought I would be in," Curry stated on the Gil's Arena Show, which was previously reported here on&nbsp;<em>Sports World News</em>.</p>
