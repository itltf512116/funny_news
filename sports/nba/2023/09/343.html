					(Photo : Ezra Shaw/Getty Images) OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA - Klay Thompson (#11) and Head coach Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors react against the Toronto Raptors in the first half during Game Four of the 2019 NBA Finals at ORACLE Arena on June 07, 2019 in Oakland, California.
				<p>Golden State Warriors majority owner Joe Lacob&nbsp;&nbsp;they are now undergoing preliminary discussions about the contract extensions for star Klay Thompson and head coach Steve Kerr.</p>
<p>Both contracts are set to expire after the 2023-24 NBA season.</p>
<p>Lacob told Tim Kawakami of&nbsp;<em>The Athletic</em>&nbsp;that they've had brief discussions with Thompson's agent, Greg Lawrence.</p>
<p>The 67-year-old businessman noted that talks are at a "very early" stage, but he fully expects they will have some substantial discussions soon.</p>
<p>"We'll see if we can't put something together that allows Klay to be here for a long time, which we clearly would like him to be," Lacob said.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old is entering the final year of a $190 million contract extension&nbsp;&nbsp;in the summer of 2019, which will see him earn $43 million for 2023-24.</p>

<h2>Recent contracts could impact Kerr's future deal</h2>
<p>In the same interview, Lacob said that, just like Thompson, the team would want to keep their decorated coach for a long time.</p>
<p>Kerr's deal&nbsp;&nbsp;by the recent deals of the Detroit Pistons' Monty Williams, who signed a six-year, $78.5 million deal, the largest contract by an NBA coach at the time of the signing.</p>
<p>Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich broke the record a few months after, inking a five-year, $80 million deal to stay in San Antonio.</p>
<p>Kerr, next to Popovich, is the second-most decorated active head coach in the NBA, with four NBA titles.</p>
