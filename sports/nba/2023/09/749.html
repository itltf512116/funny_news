					(Photo : Ezra Shaw/Getty Images) OAKLAND, CA - (L-R) 2017 NBA Championship rings are seen on the hands of team owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber during their NBA game at ORACLE Arena on October 17, 2017 in Oakland, California. 
				<p>The Golden State Warriors&nbsp;&nbsp;to bring a Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) expansion franchise to the Bay Area, according to team insider Marcus Thompson II of&nbsp;<em>The Athletic</em>.</p>
<p>No official pact has been completed yet, as the parties involved are still finalizing several key details that need to be sorted out. Once approved, an announcement could come as quickly as October.</p>
<p>Even after an agreement is reached, it must still undergo approval by the WNBA Board of Governors.</p>
<p>The seven-time NBA champions will&nbsp;&nbsp;the potential WNBA franchise, which will play their home games at the Warriors' modern home arena, Chase Center.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the team will be headquartered at the Warriors' practice facility in Oakland, California, which the team continues to own to maintain a presence in the community.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the Warriors were previously based in Oakland from 1971 to 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>WNBA commissioner previously favored an expansion</h2>
<p>WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said last year&nbsp;&nbsp;the 12-team league by adding two more teams, beginning in 2025 at the latest.</p>
<p>For Warriors owner Joe Lacob, owning a WNBA franchise would be a significant and full-circle moment in his involvement with women's basketball.</p>
<p>Lacob was a primary investor in the American Basketball League, a short-lived women's league that began its inaugural season in the fall of 1996 and lasted until 1998.</p>
