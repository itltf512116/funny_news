<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Veteran free agent forward Andre Iguodala &nbsp;about Houston Rockets guard Dillion Brooks.</p>
<p>During a recent appearance on former NBA player turned <em>ESPN </em>analyst JJ Redick's podcast <em>The Old Man and the Three</em>, the four-time NBA champion claimed that&nbsp;the 27-year-old has a "crazy mentality" that enabled him to enter the world's premier basketball league.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs certain guys in the NBA that wouldn‚Äôt be in the NBA if they didn‚Äôt have that crazy mentality‚Ä¶ If Dillon Brooks wasn‚Äôt crazy, he wouldn‚Äôt be in the NBA.‚Äù<br><br>‚Äì Andre Iguodala <br><br>Thoughts? ü§î<br><br>(via )</p>&mdash; ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>The 2015 NBA Finals Most Valuable Player explained that certain guys in the league wouldn't be in there if they didn't have that crazy mentality of how they view themselves, listing the former Memphis Grizzlies member as an example.</p>
<p>"There's a selfishness with how they view themselves. If Dillon Brooks wasn't crazy, he wouldn't be in the NBA," Iguodala said.</p>
<p>Brooks was selected by the Memphis Grizzlies in the second round of the 2017 NBA Draft with the 45th overall pick, and he was part of the team's core until he was released following their elimination in the 2023 NBA Playoffs.</p>

<h2>Brooks applauded for professionalism</h2>
<p>Brooks recently represented Canada in the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, and the national team's head coach, Toni Canyameras, &nbsp;but kind words for the 2023 All-NBA Defensive Second Team selection.</p>
<p>"He is nothing more than a normal person who comes in and is very professional. He takes good care of himself (and does) all the work to be 100% ready to play. His work in the gym, the things he does on his own - he is a superb professional," Canyameras said about Brooks.</p>
