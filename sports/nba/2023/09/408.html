					(Photo : Dylan Buell/Getty Images) CINCINNATI, OHIO - Joe Burrow (#9) of the Cincinnati Bengals throws a pass against the Baltimore Ravens during the second half in the AFC Wild Card playoff game at Paycor Stadium on January 15, 2023 in Cincinnati, Ohio.

<h2>Contract extension looming for Burrow</h2>
<p>Burrow will be entering the final year of his rookie contract, and he is eligible for a lucrative contract extension.</p>
