<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The Jacksonville Jaguars &nbsp;a 17-9 loss at the hands of defending Super Bowl champions Kansas City Chiefs at home in the Everbank Stadium.</p>
<p>Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence admitted that&nbsp;their performance was not up to par.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trevor Lawrence: “It was just a sloppy game... We’re a better team than that. It’s kind of embarrassing.”<br><br>Jaguars now have gone 3-12 on 3rd down for 2nd straight week. They went 0-3 in red zone today too. </p>&mdash; Cameron Wolfe (@CameronWolfe) </blockquote>

<p>"It was just a sloppy game... We're a better team than that. It's kind of embarrassing," the 23-year-old said.</p>
<p>The first overall pick of the 2021 NFL Draft completed just 22 of 41 passes for 216 yards, and he did not have a single touchdown or interception.</p>
<p>The 2022 Pro Bowl selection added five rushing attempts for 26 yards and fumbled twice, losing one.</p>
<p>The Jags ended the game with a 3-for-12 conversion record on third downs for the second straight week. They also went 0-for-3 in the red zone.</p>

<h2>Two key players from Chiefs return in Week 2</h2>
<p>Two important players for the reigning Super Bowl champions &nbsp;for their Week 2 game.</p>
<p>Tight end Travis Kelce is back after sustaining a knee injury before the start of the season, receiving a touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes early in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, defensive tackle Chris Jones returned after a holdout that lasted the whole offseason following a new contract that will make him earn more money this season than his old deal.</p>
<p>The Chiefs avoided becoming the first Super Bowl champions to start the season 0-2 since the Denver Broncos in 1999.</p>
