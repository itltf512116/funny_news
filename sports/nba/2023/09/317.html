					(Photo : Amanda Loman/Getty Images) PORTLAND, OREGON - JaVale McGee (#00) of the Dallas Mavericks warms up prior to a game against the Portland Trail Blazers at Moda Center on January 15, 2023 in Portland, Oregon.
				<p>The Sacramento Kings will sign three-time NBA champion JaVale McGee to a one-year minimum contract,&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris Haynes of&nbsp;<em>TNT&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Bleacher Report</em>.</p>
<p>The 7-foot big man&nbsp;&nbsp;three-year deal for $20 million with the Dallas Mavericks in July 2022, but he was waived earlier this week by the team with two years left in his contract.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old was the starting center of Dallas for their first seven games last season before being relegated to the bench. He played sparingly for the rest of the campaign.</p>
<p>McGee&nbsp;&nbsp;4.4 points and 2.5 rebounds in 42 appearances last season. Career-wise, he averages 7.8 points and 5.2 rebounds per game.</p>
<p>The former Nevada player won the NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors in 2017 and 2018, as well as the Los Angeles Lakers during the NBA bubble in 2020. He was also a part of Team USA, which won the gold medal in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>JaVale McGee follows mother's footsteps</h2>
<p>McGee's mother, Pamela, was a former professional basketball player, having spent two seasons in the WNBA. Before her professional career, she won a gold medal for Team USA in the 1984 Olympics.</p>
<p>She was selected with the 2nd overall pick in the inaugural WNBA draft in 1997 by the Sacramento Monarchs. Pamela's sophomore season would be her last in the WNBA, spending it with the Los Angeles Sparks.</p>
<p>With JaVale's impending move to the Kings, the mother-son duo&nbsp;&nbsp;for Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Team USA.&nbsp;</p>
