<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr &nbsp;despite having yet to agree to a contract extension with the team he has coached for the past nine seasons.</p>
<p>The 57-year-old mentor said he feels great about his position in the organization and is not stressed about not having an extension at all.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;I&#39;m not stressed about it at all.&quot;<br><br>Steve Kerr shares where things stand with his contract extension </p>&mdash; Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>"I'm perfectly capable of coaching whether I have one year left or an extension. Makes no difference but I fully expect to be here," the four-time NBA champion tactician said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. confirmed that extending the contracts of Kerr and star Klay Thompson is a priority for the franchise.</p>
<p>Dunleavy Jr. &nbsp;there is a desire for Kerr, Thompson, and the franchise to be on the same page and work together in the team moving forward.</p>
<p>"Both sides feel that way and when you're working off of that idea, you can come to a deal," the 43-year-old executive said.</p>

<h2>Kerr could command massive payday</h2>
<p>Kerr reportedly earns $8 million annually for coaching the San Francisco-based team. That number could exponentially rise with his new deal following a reset in the coaching market this offseason.</p>
<p>After Monty Williams secured a historic six-year, $78.5 million contract to lead the Detroit Pistons, while Gregg Popovich committed to a five-year, $80 million deal to stay with the San Antonio Spurs, Kerr &nbsp;an annual pay of $20 million, per Adrian Wojnarowski of <em>ESPN</em>.</p>
