					(Photo : Elsa/Getty Images) NEW YORK, NEW YORK - Jalen Brunson (#11) of the New York Knicks waits for the clock to run out ending game five of the Eastern Conference semifinals at Madison Square Garden on May 10, 2023 in New York City. The New York Knicks defeated the Miami Heat 112-103. 
				<p>New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson&nbsp;&nbsp;an offer by Michael Jordan to autograph his jersey.</p>
<p>NBA reporter Ohm Youngmisuk of&nbsp;<em>ESPN&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;on the network's&nbsp;<em>NBA Today</em>&nbsp;with co-hosts Malika Andrews and Marc Spears.</p>
<p>Youngmisuk said the funny incident happened when the two-time NCAA champion was five years old, and Jordan was on the tail end of his career playing for the Washington Wizards.</p>
<p>Brunson's father Rick, who also played in the league and now serves as an assistant coach for the Knicks, bought his son a brand new white Michael Jordan Washington Wizards jersey during that time.</p>
<p>Rick brought Brunson to the locker room area, where Patrick Ewing saw the young Brunson's jersey and offered to bring the item to His Airness to be signed.</p>
<p>A few moments later, Jordan emerged and saw the Brunsons and Ewing. Upon seeing the younger Brunson's gear, the six-time NBA champion eventually asked, "Do you want me to autograph that jersey?"</p>
<p>"Jalen Brunson doesn't know who Michael Jordan is and said 'No, you'll ruin the jersey," Youngmisuk concluded, drawing amusement from his co-hosts.</p>

<h2>Jalen Brunson regrets turning down MJ</h2>
<p>Youngmisuk&nbsp;&nbsp;the Team USA member during the last 2023 FIBA World Cup is annoyed by his own actions as a kid.</p>
<p>"Obviously, to this day, [Jalen] still regrets that, but yes, he did turn down the GOAT," the journalist quipped.&nbsp;</p>
