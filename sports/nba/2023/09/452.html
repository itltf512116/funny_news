					(Photo : Harry How/Getty Images) LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - Anthony Davis (#3) of the Los Angeles Lakers drives to the basket against Nikola Jokic (#15) of the Denver Nuggets during the first quarter in game three of the Western Conference Finals at Crypto.com Arena on May 20, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. 
				<p>There was a short period during the 2010s when many analysts and fans&nbsp;&nbsp;center position was "dead."</p>
<p>The emergence of dynamic guards and forwards who could take over the game like big men used to and teams winning championships without a true center&nbsp;.</p>
<p>In recent years, the trend has reversed, with centers taking up the last three NBA Most Valuable Player awards and the exploitation of teams with a lack of size in the postseason.</p>
<p>With the center position back to relevance, the best of the best comes at a price. With that being said, who are&nbsp;&nbsp;in the NBA for the 2023-24 season?</p>
<h3>1. Bam Adebayo - Miami Heat: $32,600,060&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Adebayo has been a consistent inside presence for the Miami Heat, helping the team make the NBA Finals in two of the last four seasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Heat rewarded the 26-year-old in 2020 with a five-year, $163 million extension that&nbsp;the 2025-26 NBA season.</p>
<h3>2. Karl-Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves: $36,016,200</h3>
<p>Towns is acclaimed as one of the best shooting big men ever, and&nbsp;&nbsp;to win the Three-Point Contest during the 2022 edition since Dirk Nowitzki in 2006.</p>
<p>The first overall pick of the 2015 NBA Draft will be entering the final year of his current deal, but&nbsp;&nbsp;$224 million supermax extension that will put him higher on this list next season.</p>
<h3>3. Anthony Davis - Los Angeles Lakers: $40,600,080</h3>
<p>While Davis is a power forward on paper, the Lakers big man has spent the last few years playing the five for the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
<p>Named in the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021, the 30-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;in NBA history last month.</p>
<h3>4. Rudy Gobert - Minnesota Timberwolves: $41,000,000&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Gobert is one of the most dominant rim protectors in league history, claiming three NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards in 2018, 2019, and 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Frenchman&nbsp;&nbsp;NBA All-Defensive First Team for six straight seasons from 2017 to 2022.</p>

<h2>Tied-1. Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers: $47,607,350&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The Philadelphia 76ers center is the reigning NBA Most Valuable Player,&nbsp;&nbsp;with solid performances throughout the year.</p>
<p>In addition, he also led the league in scoring for the second year in a row in 2022-23.</p>
<p>The last few years have been a dominant run for the 29-year-old, as he also finished second in MVP voting in 2021 and 2022, establishing himself as one of the premier players in the NBA.</p>
<h2>Tied-1. Nikola Jokic - Denver Nuggets: $47,607,350&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The Serbian big man is the joint-highest-paid center in the NBA for the upcoming season, and we all know why.</p>
<p>Jokic recently led the Denver Nuggets to their first NBA championship, capping off a dominant playoff run that saw him break several postseason records and cement his place among the greatest centers of all time.</p>
<p>Jokic&nbsp;&nbsp;five-year, $264 million contract extension with the Nuggets in 2022, the largest contract in NBA history at its signing.&nbsp;</p>
