					(Photo : Ron Jenkins/Getty Images) DALLAS, TEXAS - Head coach Kim Mulkey of the LSU Lady Tigers speaks during a press conference after the LSU Lady Tigers beat the Iowa Hawkeyes 102-85 during the 2023 NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament championship game at American Airlines Center on April 02, 2023 in Dallas, Texas. 
				<p>Louisiana State University (LSU) women's basketball coach Kim Mulkey&nbsp;&nbsp;the most lucrative deal in women's college basketball history to remain with the Tigers.</p>
<p>The 61-year-old will sign a new 10-year contract worth $32 million, which is subject to approval by the LSU board of supervisors, which meets on Friday, according to&nbsp;<em>ESPN</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new deal, which has an average annual value of $3.2 million, will earn Mulkey $2.75 million in the first year and will gradually rise to $3.65 million by the final year in 2033,&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>NOLA.com</em>.</p>
<p>In contrast, LSU Tigers men's basketball head coach Matt McMahon earns $2.9 million annually, while national title winning-baseball coach Jay Johnson earned $1.25 million last season.</p>
<p>Mulkey will also be the second-highest-paid coach among the university's varsity teams, next to LSU Tigers football coach Brian Kelly.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Mulkey turned around LSU's women's basketball program</h2>
<p>Since arriving in Louisiana in 2021, Mulkey has reversed the fortunes of the university's women's basketball program.</p>
<p>An alumni of nearby rivals Louisiana Tech, Mulkey led the LSU Tigers women's basketball team&nbsp;last April with the help of tournament Most Outstanding Player Angel Reese.</p>
<p>Before joining LSU, Mulkey spent 21 seasons as the head coach of the women's basketball team at Baylor University, where she won three national titles in 2005, 2012, and 2019.</p>
