<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The Cincinnati Bengals &nbsp;their franchise quarterback, Joe Burrow, for the next five years, and it wasn't cheap.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old has agreed to a five-year contract extension worth $275 million, which includes $219.01 million in guaranteed money to stay in Cincinnati, according to&nbsp;NFL insider Adam Schefter of <em>ESPN</em>.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A record deal: Joe Burrow has reached agreement with the Bengals on an 5-year, $275 million extension that includes $219.01 million guaranteed and makes him the highest-paid player in NFL history, sources tell ESPN. </p>&mdash; Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>The new deal makes the 2022 Pro Bowl selection the highest-paid player in NFL history, &nbsp;of $55 million over the next half-decade.</p>
<p>The deal ends months of negotiation between the two parties, which has been the subject of much speculation by fans and the media.</p>
<p>Burrow's new deal is the second largest contract in league history in terms of total overall value, next to Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes' 10-year, $503 million deal that he signed in 2020.</p>

<h2>Joe Burrow wants to stay in Cincinnati for his whole NFL career</h2>
<p>Burrow &nbsp;Wednesday, September 6, that he plans to stay with the franchise that drafted him for his whole career.</p>
<p>"This is where I want to be. This is where I want to be my whole career. We're working toward making that happen," the 2019 Heisman Trophy winner said yesterday regarding the speculated contract extension.</p>
<p>The Bengals selected Burrow with the first overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft.</p>
<p>After an injury-plagued rookie year, Burrow reversed the fortunes of a franchise that saw a lack of success since their inception, leading the Bengals to a Super Bowl LVI appearance, where they came up short against the Los Angeles Rams.</p>
