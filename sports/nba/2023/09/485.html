					(Photo : David Eulitt/Getty Images) KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI - Chris Jones (#95) of the Kansas City Chiefs reacts after sacking Joe Burrow (#9) of the Cincinnati Bengals during the first quarter in the AFC Championship Game at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on January 29, 2023 in Kansas City, Missouri.
				<p>Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones has agreed to a new one-year deal with the team,&nbsp;&nbsp;from his current contract.</p>
<p>However, the new pact offered more incentives for the 2022 First Team All-Pro to earn significantly more than the $19.5 million he was initially set to earn for the 2023 NFL season, according to league insider Adam Schefter of&nbsp;<em>ESPN</em>. The exact financial details were not disclosed.</p>
<p>There will be another negotiation round between the two parties after the current campaign.</p>
<p>"Chris is an elite player in this league, and over the last seven years, he's really developed into a leader on our team," Chiefs general manager Brett Veach said&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 45-year-old executive added that Jones has been instrumental to Kansas City's success and Super Bowl championship runs, and it was a priority for the front office to keep him in a Chiefs uniform.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Chris Jones ends holdout</h2>
<p>The 29-year-old&nbsp;, which caused him to miss all of the team's preseason activities, including training camp and their season opener against the Detroit Lions last Thursday, September 7,&nbsp;&nbsp;a $1.1 million game check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The four-time Pro Bowl selection will be suiting up for the Chiefs in their Week 2 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on the road this coming Sunday.</p>
