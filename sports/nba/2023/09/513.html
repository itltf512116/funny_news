<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo &nbsp;NBA championship at all costs, and he is willing to leave his current team if that's what it takes.</p>
<p>In &nbsp;<em>48 Minutes</em>&nbsp;podcast this week, the 2021 NBA Finals MVP said he is a Milwaukee Buck, but most importantly, a winner.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;I&#39;m a Milwaukee Buck, but most importantly I&#39;m a winner. ... If there is a better situation for me to win the Larry O&#39;Brien I have to take that better situation.&quot;<br><br>Giannis on his future with the Bucks. </p>&mdash; NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>"I have to do whatever it takes for me to win. And if there's a better situation for me to win the Larry O'Brien, I have to take that better situation," the 28-year-old said.</p>
<p>The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player has three full seasons left in his current Bucks contract, with the last one being a player option. He is set to make $45.6 million for 2023-24.</p>

<h2>Giannis Antetokounmpo put pressure on Bucks front office again</h2>
<p>This is the second time Antetokounmpo has put pressure on the Bucks front office to build a roster that could win the NBA championship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;with the<em>&nbsp;New York Times</em>&nbsp;last month, the seven-time NBA All-Star said that his signing another contract extension in Milwaukee is not guaranteed, and it &nbsp;Bucks being a championship-contending team.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, being a winner, it's over that goal. Winning a championship comes first. I don't want to be 20 years on the same team and don't win another championship," the 2020 NBA Defensive Player of the Year said.</p>
