					(Photo : Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) ORLANDO, FL - (L-R) LeBron James (#6) of the Miami Heat and the Eastern Conference and Dwight Howard (#12) of the Orlando Magic and the Eastern Conference react during player introductions for the 2012 NBA All-Star Game at the Amway Center on February 26, 2012 in Orlando, Florida.
				<p>Winning the NBA Draft Lottery is an altering moment for any team in the league.</p>
<p>A franchise could land the best prospect in that year's class, who could be a generational talent. Some picks brought the team to new heights, while others failed to live up to the hype.</p>
<p>With that said, who are the best and worst first-overall picks in this century?</p>
<h2>The Worst</h2>
<p><strong>5. Markelle Fultz</strong></p>
<p>Picked by the 76ers in 2017, Fultz suffered a shoulder injury, which caused him to forget his shooting form,&nbsp;&nbsp;to make an impact.</p>
<p>However, the 25-year-old is now on an upward trajectory with the Magic, averaging career-highs in almost all facets of his game.</p>
<p><strong>4. Greg Oden</strong></p>
<p>This is more of a case of bad luck than lack of skill. Selected first overall by the Blazers in 2007 over Kevin Durant, Oden only played in 105 regular season games due to several injuries,&nbsp;&nbsp;knees.</p>
<p>He only appeared in the league during the 2008-09, 2009-10, and 2013-14 campaigns, being injured in the gap years.</p>
<p><strong>3. Andrea Bargnani</strong></p>
<p>While the Italian enjoyed a decade-long career after going first in the 2006 draft, his production was not on par with the expected numbers among first-overall picks.</p>
<p>After being named in the All-Rookie First Team for Toronto, Bargnani&nbsp;.</p>
<p><strong>2. Kwame Brown</strong></p>
<p>Brown was infamous for being chosen by Michael Jordan as the first overall pick for the Wizards in 2001.</p>
<p>Despite lasting 12 seasons in the league, he never averaged double digits in rebounds despite being a 6-foot-11 big man. He played for seven teams, becoming&nbsp;&nbsp;biggest busts ever.</p>
<p><strong>1. Anthony Bennett</strong></p>
<p>Bennett's selection by the Cavs in 2013 was already mind-boggling, and those who were skeptical&nbsp;.</p>
<p>He was already out of the league by 2017, bouncing among G League and overseas teams after.</p>

<h2>The Best</h2>
<p><strong>5. Derrick Rose</strong></p>
<p>The 2008 top selection would have been higher on this list if not for his injuries, but his peak is probably the highest among some names on this list.</p>
<p>Rose&nbsp;&nbsp;youngest NBA MVP ever in 2011, leading the Chicago Bulls to the best regular season record and the Eastern Conference Finals that year.</p>
<p><strong>4. Kyrie Irving</strong></p>
<p>Selected by Cleveland in 2011, Irving remains one of the best guards in the NBA today and one of the greatest ball-handlers ever.</p>
<p>He&nbsp;&nbsp;the biggest shot in Cavs history, nailing a three-pointer, which gave them the lead for good in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals.</p>
<p><strong>3. Anthony Davis</strong></p>
<p>The Pelicans picked Davis in 2012 after a decorated college career in Kentucky, and he brought his dominance to the NBA.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;players in 2021, making the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.</p>
<p><strong>2. Dwight Howard</strong></p>
<p>Selected by the Magic in 2004, Howard was one of the most dominant centers ever during his peak, winning three straight NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards from 2009 to 2011.</p>
<p>His exclusion from the NBA 75th Anniversary Team&nbsp;&nbsp;from fans, coaches, and analysts.</p>
<p><strong>1. LeBron James</strong></p>
<p>This one is not a debate. Besides Michael Jordan, James is regarded as the greatest basketball player of all time.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old has led three teams to NBA titles, including the Cavaliers, who selected him in 2003.</p>
<p>James&nbsp;&nbsp;NBA's all-time leading scorer in February 2023, breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's coveted record.&nbsp;</p>
