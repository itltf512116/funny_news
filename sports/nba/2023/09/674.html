<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>After the Indiana Pacers and sharpshooter Buddy Hield failed to agree on terms for a contract extension, possible trade destinations have emerged&nbsp;after the team &nbsp;for the 30-year-old around the league.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;The Lakers were long rumored for Buddy Hield... You look at teams like Dallas, Philly, Milwaukee. Those are the types of teams that could definitely use a shooter like Buddy Hield.&quot;<br><br>NBA Insider  on potential landing spots for Hield. |  </p>&mdash; The Rally (@TheRally) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>During &nbsp;on Bally Sports, NBA insider Shams Charania listed several championship contenders who are keen on landing the 2020 NBA Three-Point Contest champion.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Lakers have been long rumored to have significant interest in Hield, but the league insider &nbsp;the Dallas Mavericks, the Philadelphia 76ers, and the Milwaukee Bucks as those who could use the former Oklahoma Sooners player on their team.</p>
<p>Charania also noted that Pacers Basketball Operations President Kevin Pritchard remained non-committal when asked about a possible contract extension for Hield last April.</p>
<p>A possible trade is also not likely to happen until the 2023-24 regular season begins. Hield is entering the final year of his current contract, wherein &nbsp;$19.2 million, per <em>HoopsHype</em>.</p>

<h2>Contract breakdown due to role</h2>
<p>Charania added that the Pacers did not give Hield an extension because of the emergence of other young guys on the team that plays the same role as the former Sacramento King.</p>
<p>The Pacers are counting on the continued growth of their youth movement that includes Tyrese Haliburton, Bennedict Mathurin, and Andrew Nembhard moving forward.</p>
