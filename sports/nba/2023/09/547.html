					(Photo : Sarah Stier/Getty Images) NEW YORK, NEW YORK - Kobe Bufkin (R) poses with NBA commissioner Adam Silver (L) after being drafted 15th overall pick by the Atlanta Hawks during the first round of the 2023 NBA Draft at Barclays Center on June 22, 2023 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. 
				<p>The Atlanta Hawks&nbsp;&nbsp;the Toronto Raptors for their star Pascal Siakam over the summer, but talks broke down for a surprising reason.</p>
<p>The Hawks were the franchise that showed the most interest in the two-time NBA All-Star.</p>
<p>However, the team&nbsp;&nbsp;Kobe Bufkin, the team's lottery pick this year, in the trade package to acquire the two-time All-NBA selection, according to league insider Michael Sotto of&nbsp;<em>HoopsHype</em>.</p>
<p>Bufkin, a 6-foot-5 combo guard from Michigan, was selected by Atlanta with the 15th overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft.</p>
<p>Sotto added that the Hawks' package for Siakam, which included De'Andre Hunter, AJ Griffin, and a draft pick compensation,&nbsp;, as the team was adamant about not including the 19-year-old alongside the potential transaction.</p>
<p>"There was a young player the Hawks didn't want to include that's worth noting should the teams revisit trade discussions," Sotto wrote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bufkin averaged 19.3 points and 5.6 rebounds, shooting 51.9 percent from the field and 45 percent from beyond the arc in his last eight games as a Wolverine.</p>
<p>Hawks head coach Quinn Synder reportedly has high hopes for the prospect.</p>

<h2>Toronto Raptors also considered selecting Kobe Bufkin</h2>
<p>The Raptors held the 13th overall pick in this year's draft, and they were considering using the selection to pick the former Michigan player.</p>
<p>Instead, they opted to choose Gradey Dick with the pick. The 19-year-old is a 6-foot-8 wing out of Kansas.</p>
