					(Photo : JEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIX/AFP via Getty Images)) US basketball player Kobe Bryant and wife Vanessa Laine Bryant attend the 2019 Vanity Fair Oscar Party following the 91st Academy Awards at The Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills on February 24, 2019. 
				<p>Vanessa Bryant is the widow of the late basketball great Kobe Bryant, and she inherited most of the Los Angeles Lakers star's assets.</p>
<p>The socialite, philanthropist, and businesswoman has been managing her husband's estate since&nbsp;&nbsp;in January 2020, and it continues to make more money posthumously, with various brands still wanting to be affiliated with the Black Mamba's image and likeness.</p>
<p>With that being said, what is Vanessa Bryant's net worth in 2023?</p>
<h2>Vanessa Bryant Net Worth 2023</h2>
<p>The 41-year-old Bryant is worth $600 million as of 2023, according to&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The majority of the figure comes from her husband's highly successful basketball career, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time.</p>
<p>Kobe and Vanessa did not sign a pre-nuptial agreement during their wedding in 2001. Hence, they share the same assets and wealth.</p>
<h2>Kobe Bryant's net worth at the time of his death</h2>
<p>At the time of his death,&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;the former Laker to be worth the same figure at $600 million in January 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The five-time NBA champion made over $328 million in salary from the Lakers over the course of a 20-year career in the NBA,&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>HoopsHype</em>.</p>
<p>Adding endorsements, he made $680 million from 1996 to 2016.</p>
<p>The two-time NBA Finals MVP was also the highest-paid player in the NBA from the 2009-10 season until his final campaign in 2015-16.</p>

<h2>Big payoff from investment</h2>
<p>Kobe Bryant was one of the earliest investors in the sports drink BodyArmor, shelling out $6 million in 2014 for a ten percent stake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late 2021, the company was sold to Coca-Cola for $5.6 billion, and the 2008 NBA MVP's initial investment&nbsp;&nbsp;a stunning $400 million payout to his family in just seven years, more than what he earned in NBA salary in two decades.</p>
<h2>Posthumous endorsements</h2>
<p>Vanessa Bryant continues to do business deals bearing her late husband's name three years after the tragic helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.</p>
<p>In April 2021, Bryant&nbsp;&nbsp;Kobe's longtime deal with sportswear giant Nike expire. One of the reasons she cited was the company's limited production of Kobe Bryant sneakers, which consistently sold out in minutes after every launch.</p>
<p>"My hope will always be to allow Kobe's fans to get and wear his products. I will continue to fight for that," Vanessa Bryant said back then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With her staunch negotiation, Bryant's estate and Nike&nbsp;&nbsp;almost a year later, in March 2022, with the company promising to produce more products and help the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation initiatives.</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant made $10 million annually from Nike during his playing days, and the figure could be higher today with the increased demand for his sneakers.</p>
