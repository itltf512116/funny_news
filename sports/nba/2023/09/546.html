					(Photo : Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - NBA commissioner Adam Silver speaks to the media prior to Game One of the 2022 NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Boston Celtics at Chase Center on June 02, 2022 in San Francisco, California. 
				<p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver&nbsp;&nbsp;on the recent multiple trade requests made by the league's players while contracted by their respective teams.</p>
<p>"In terms of trade demands, of course, don't like them, as a league. I want players and teams to both honor their contracts," the 61-year-old executive&nbsp;&nbsp;on Wednesday, September 13.</p>
<p>Silver also said that&nbsp;&nbsp;both the situations in Portland and Philadelphia, and he hopes they get worked out to the satisfaction of everyone before the season begins.</p>
<p>"I'm glad it seems to have calmed down as far as public discourse," the NBA commissioner added.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Lillard and Harden's trade requests</h2>
<p>Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard notably requested a trade out of the team during the beginning of free agency last July, and he only prefers the Miami Heat as a landing spot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NBA 75th Anniversary team member is under contract with the Oregon-based team until the 2025-26 NBA season, and he has an additional player option with the team for 2026-27.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sixers star James Harden opted in his player option with the team for the upcoming season after failing to find a suitable team in free agency that could match or exceed his $35.6 million salary for 2023-24.</p>
<p>The 2018 NBA Most Valuable Player opted in with the expectation of being traded, but Sixers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey brought Harden back to the team against his wishes, calling off trade talks to the player's preferred destination - the Los Angeles Clippers.</p>
