				<p>Houston Rockets guard Kevin Porter Jr.&nbsp;&nbsp;in New York City for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend, former WNBA player Kysre Gondrezick, at a hotel on Monday morning.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old Rockets player was officially charged with assault and strangulation, both felonies.</p>
<p>The New York City Police Department&nbsp;, officers were informed that a 26-year-old female sustained a laceration to the right side of her face and complained about neck pain.</p>
<p>"A preliminary investigation on scene determined that a known individual struck her multiple times upon her body and placed his hands around the neck," the statement added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Rockets are gathering information surrounding the matter involving their player, and the NBA is also in contact with the franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Kevin Porter Jr's girlfriend was a former WNBA lottery pick</h2>
<p>Porter's partner, former WNBA player Kysre Gondrezick, was the alleged victim of the incident.</p>
<p>The Indiana Fever selected the 26-year-old with the fourth overall pick in the 2021 WNBA Draft. She spent her rookie year in Indiana&nbsp;&nbsp;in January 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She signed with the Chicago Sky for the team's 2022 training camp but was released before the season started.</p>
<p>Gondrezick has not played the last two WNBA seasons and is currently a free agent. She played college basketball for Michigan and West Virginia.</p>
