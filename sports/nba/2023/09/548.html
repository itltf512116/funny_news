<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Former NBA player Metta World Peace, also known as Ron Artest, &nbsp;over the course of 19 seasons playing in the world's premier basketball league.</p>
<p>During a recent episode of <em>The Hoop Chat with Emily Austin</em>, the 43-year-old said that&nbsp;he wishes that he was able to play for the New York Knicks during his prime.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If only Metta World Peace could turn back time‚Ä¶ üß°‚è∞üíô </p>&mdash; The Hoop Chat (@thehoopchat) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>"If you really wanna play with time, imagine if we could move that prime Metta to the Knicks. I wish I could reverse time, I would put myself in a Knicks jersey in my prime, not my old Metta World Peace, when I can't even run anymore," World Peace said.</p>
<p>World Peace is a native of New York City, being &nbsp;in the Queens borough of the city.</p>
<p>The 2010 NBA champion attended high school at La Salle Academy in Manhattan and played college basketball at St. John's University in Queens.</p>

<h2>Metta World Peace was able to play for the Knicks</h2>
<p>World Peace did achieve his dream of playing for the New York Knicks, but he was already in the twilight of his career when it happened.</p>
<p>The 2004 NBA Defensive Player of the Year signed a two-year deal with the team in July 2013, but his time with the Knicks was largely forgettable.</p>
<p>The two-time NBA All-Defensive First Team member only appeared in 29 games for New York, averaging 4.8 points and 2.0 rebounds in 13.4 minutes per game.</p>
<p>World Peace &nbsp;of his contract in February 2014.</p>
