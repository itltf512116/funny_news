<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is looking to&nbsp;boost his team at all costs.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jayson Tatum reportedly spoke to Damian Lillard about a making a move to Boston. üëÄ‚òòÔ∏è </p>&mdash; theScore (@theScore) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>The 25-year-old reportedly spoke to Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard, &nbsp;NBA 75th Anniversary Team member to join the Celtics potentially, NBA insider Marc J. Spears of <em>ESPN </em>said in the <em>Sports By Northwest</em>&nbsp;podcast by <em>The Oregonian</em>.</p>
<p>"And I know that Boston, I know Jayson Tatum has called him, try to get in his ear," Spears said.</p>
<p>Lillard notably requested a trade out of Portland during the beginning of free agency two months ago, but the franchise has not dealt him yet with a few weeks left before training camp.</p>

<h2>Lillard remains focused on Miami</h2>
<p>The NBA insider added that the 33-year-old guard &nbsp;on getting to the Miami Heat.</p>
<p>Spears said that Lillard has a military basketball mentality, where his work ethic would fit in the Heat's renowned culture.</p>
<p>The seven-time NBA All-Star also likes the organization's stability, with Pat Riley serving as the team president since 1995 and Erik Spoelstra coaching the team since 2008.</p>
<p>Other perks, such as Florida's sunshine and state tax, help, but the biggest factor is the winning culture, with the team making the Finals seven times since their first title in 2006. The team recently made the 2023 NBA Finals as an eight-seed against all odds.</p>
<p>There is also a bigger chance to get into the NBA Finals through the Eastern Conference than the loaded West.</p>
