					(Photo : Mitchell Leff/Getty Images) PHILADELPHIA, PA - Joel Embiid (#21) of the Philadelphia 76ers reacts against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first quarter at the Wells Fargo Center on January 12, 2023 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Thunder defeated the 76ers 133-114.
				<p>The French national basketball team&nbsp;&nbsp;of Tuesday, October 10, 2023, for Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid to decide regarding his participation in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre Siutat, the president of the French Basketball Federation, revealed during a French radio interview that&nbsp;&nbsp;from the reigning NBA Most Valuable Player by the specified deadline.</p>
<p>"It will happen very quickly in all cases. We hope so and I think he knows it. We may have an answer by October 10. We have set this deadline," the president said.</p>
<p>Rumors have floated suggesting that Embiid has chosen France, but Siutat rebuffed them.</p>
<p>"Today, he is still not with us. We are working on it, we have a firm desire to do it," Siutat mentioned.</p>

<h2>Joel Embiid is eligible to play for three countries</h2>
<p>The 29-year-old is eligible to play as a naturalized player for France and the USA since he holds citizenship in both countries.</p>
<p>Embiid was granted French citizenship in July 2022, while he received his US citizenship a few months later in September 2022.</p>
<p>Additionally, he retains the option to represent his native Cameroon.</p>
<p>The six-time NBA All-Star has not previously played for any national team during his international career. Thus, he enjoys the freedom to choose between the three eligible countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, United States men's national basketball team managing director Grant Hill&nbsp;&nbsp;Team USA is also in talks with Embiid to represent the country next year in Paris.</p>
