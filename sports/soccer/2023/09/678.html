					(Photo : Alex Grimm/Getty Images) MUNICH, GERMANY - Andre Onana and team mates of Manchester United reacts after Serge Gnabry of Bayern Munich scores their sides second goal during the UEFA Champions League match between FC Bayern München and Manchester United at Allianz Arena on September 20, 2023 in Munich, Germany. 
				<p>Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana&nbsp;&nbsp;on Wednesday, September 19, after the Red Devils suffered a 4-3 loss against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League group stages held at the Allianz Arena.</p>
<p>The Cameroonian took the blame for the defeat after conceding four goals, which were scored by Leroy Sane, Serge Gnabry, Harry Kane, and Matthys Tel.</p>
<p>"It's a difficult situation for us, and me, as I let the team down. The team was really good but it was because of me we didn't win this game," the 27-year-old said.</p>
<p>Onana committed a critical mistake, leading to Bayern taking the lead as he allowed San&eacute;'s low-powered shot to slide beneath him in the 28th minute.</p>
<p>He has&nbsp;&nbsp;for conceding goals in Premier League matches against Nottingham Forest, Arsenal, and Brighton.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recent loss marked the third consecutive defeat for Erik ten Hag's squad.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Erik ten Hag had some words for Onana</h2>
<p>Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag&nbsp;&nbsp;to Onana despite his difficult evening.</p>
<p>The Dutch tactician praised his goalkeeper for accepting responsibility for the defeat while noting the silver lining that he did in the game.</p>
<p>"In the second half, he made great saves for us, he showed his capabilities and he will bounce back for us, he is an important player," the 53-year-old said.&nbsp;</p>
