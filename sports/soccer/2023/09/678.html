				<p>Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana&nbsp;&nbsp;on Wednesday, September 19, after the Red Devils suffered a 4-3 loss against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League group stages held at the Allianz Arena.</p>
<p>The Cameroonian took the blame for the defeat after conceding four goals, which were scored by Leroy Sane, Serge Gnabry, Harry Kane, and Matthys Tel.</p>
<p>"It's a difficult situation for us, and me, as I let the team down. The team was really good but it was because of me we didn't win this game," the 27-year-old said.</p>
<p>Onana committed a critical mistake, leading to Bayern taking the lead as he allowed San&eacute;'s low-powered shot to slide beneath him in the 28th minute.</p>
<p>He has&nbsp;&nbsp;for conceding goals in Premier League matches against Nottingham Forest, Arsenal, and Brighton.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recent loss marked the third consecutive defeat for Erik ten Hag's squad.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Erik ten Hag had some words for Onana</h2>
<p>Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag&nbsp;&nbsp;to Onana despite his difficult evening.</p>
<p>The Dutch tactician praised his goalkeeper for accepting responsibility for the defeat while noting the silver lining that he did in the game.</p>
<p>"In the second half, he made great saves for us, he showed his capabilities and he will bounce back for us, he is an important player," the 53-year-old said.&nbsp;</p>
