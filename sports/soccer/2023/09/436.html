					(Photo : LLUIS GENE/AFP via Getty Images) Barcelona's German midfielder (#22) Ilkay Gundogan gestures during the Spanish Liga football match between FC Barcelona and Cadiz CF at the Lluis Companys Olimpic Stadium in Barcelona on August 20, 2023. 
				<p>Former Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan&nbsp;&nbsp;with manager Pep Guardiola when he informed him that he would leave for Spanish giants FC Barcelona.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;that he could not say goodbye to Guardiola in person because he only decided to move after their UEFA Champions League triumph against Inter Milan last June.</p>
<p>Gundogan also had a game for the German national team coming up at that time, hence the conflict in schedule.</p>
<p>"The conversation was emotional, but Pep was also happy for me. I switched to the club that was close to his heart and his childhood, so to speak - and as a fan, he was very happy about that. He also told me: If I need anything, I should contact him at any time," Gundogan said, describing the exchange, which he called the most difficult phone call of his life.</p>

<h2>Barcelona close to Guardiola's heart</h2>
<p>Guardiola is notably a legend at FC Barcelona, spending most of his playing career with the La Liga side and managing the club to unprecedented success from 2008 to 2012.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gundogan&nbsp;&nbsp;of Guardiola when he arrived at the Premier League club in 2016, and the German has consistently contributed to the club's massive success over the past few years.</p>
<p>In the end, Gundogan&nbsp;&nbsp;his time in Manchester ended at the perfect time, and he also noted that it was his childhood dream to play for Barcelona.</p>
