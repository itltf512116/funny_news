<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Dallas Mavericks star Kyrie Irving knew at a young age that he would make it to the NBA.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old shared a letter&nbsp;he wrote in 4th grade, manifesting his current reality.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Power of I AM. <br><br>I Wrote it down and followed through. <br>4th Grade Version of Me is Proud I stuck with it and achieved something special. <br><br>Chief H√©l√† ü§ûüèæü™∂‚ôæ </p>&mdash; Chief H√©l√† ü§ûüèæ (@KyrieIrving) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>The letter read, "I AM GOING TO THE NBA!! Promise." The eight-time NBA All-Star will enter his 13th season in the league in 2023-24.</p>
<p>"I Wrote it down and followed through. 4th Grade Version of Me is Proud I stuck with it and achieved something special," Irving wrote on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Cavaliers drafted Irving with the first overall pick of the 2011 NBA Draft, and he nailed the biggest shot in franchise history, &nbsp;with less than a minute left during Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals to give them the lead for good and the city's first major title in 52 years.</p>
<p>The former Duke player is also regarded &nbsp;ball-handlers in the history of the NBA.</p>

<h2>New threads for Kyrie Irving</h2>
<p>The Dallas Mavericks &nbsp;Irving will be wearing the jersey No. 11 this season, which he used to wear during his stints with the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets.</p>

<p>Irving wore number 2 when he arrived on the team in a midseason trade last February.</p>
