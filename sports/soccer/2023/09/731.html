<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Former NFL Most Valuable Player Matt Ryan &nbsp;regarding rumors of him joining the New York Jets following Aaron Rodgers's season-ending Achilles injury and Zach Wilson's dismal performance against the New England Patriots during their last game last Sunday, September 24.</p>
<p>The 2016 NFL Offensive Player of the Year, currently working at <em>CBS Sports</em>&nbsp;as an analyst, saidhe's enjoying his stint in the booth and is not too keen on a comeback on the field.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;I got no interest in doing that right now.&quot;<br><br>Our very own  sets the record straight on his interest in being the next QB of the New York Jets </p>&mdash; NFL on CBS üèà (@NFLonCBS) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>Ryan praised his agent, Todd France, for looking at possible NFL opportunities for him, but he intends to remain in broadcasting in the meantime.</p>
<p>"But he and I talked and I've got no interest in doing that right now. I'm enjoying what I'm doing," the 38-year-old said.</p>
<p>Ryan spent 15 seasons in the NFL, 14 of which he played for the Atlanta Falcons. He led them to Super Bowl LI, wherein they held a 28-3 advantage against the Patriots but ultimately lost the game in overtime.</p>
<p>The 2016 First Team All-Pro was traded to the Indianapolis Colts in 2022, but his time there was dismal.</p>

<h2>Matt Ryan is not officially retired yet</h2>
<p>Despite moving on to a broadcasting career, the former Falcon . This is because officially retiring could risk losing the $12 million he's due from the Colts in 2023.</p>
<p>If he were to announce his retirement, the Colts could try to avoid paying him.</p>
