<p>The Argentine icon reflected on his storied career during a recent interview with Argentine TV personality Migue Granados on&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes, it is a job," Messi acknowledged regarding professional football, wherein he admitted that he feels lucky to do it as a job. Although playing football entails responsibilities and a goal, it is still something that he enjoys doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Messi soon revealed what his life could look like after retiring from football.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What am I going to do next? I don't know. I would like to be a sporting director, be with the kids, teach," the 36-year-old said.</p>

<h2>Messi doubles down on previous answer</h2>
<p>The former FC Barcelona forward&nbsp;&nbsp;during an interview with Argentine journalist&nbsp;&nbsp;just before the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p>

<p>The World Cup winner then mentioned his intention to become a sporting director.</p>
<p>"I would like to be the sporting director of a club, to build a team, to accompany the coaches, but I'm not sure about that," Messi added.</p>
