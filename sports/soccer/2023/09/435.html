					(Photo : Jay Biggerstaff/Getty Images) OMAHA, NEBRASKA - Paul Skenes (#20) of the LSU Tigers greets fans after winning the NCAA College World Series baseball finals against the Florida Gators at Charles Schwab Field on June 26, 2023 in Omaha, Nebraska. 
				<p>The Pittsburgh Pirates&nbsp;&nbsp;the first overall pick of the 2023 MLB Draft, Paul Skenes, for the rest of the season, as they placed him on the development list. Skenes recently made a stir for being in a relationship with popular college athlete Olivia Dunne.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason for Skene's shut down&nbsp;&nbsp;but to promote the pitcher's development as he looks to make his major league debut in 2024.</p>
<p>Pirates general manager Ben Cherington&nbsp;&nbsp;they are excited and encouraged by the positive things Skenes has accomplished in his short time in the Pirates organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 49-year-old executive also added that the 21-year-old checked all the boxes the Pirates aimed for him during the 2023 season.</p>
<p>"The goal now is to focus on a complete off-season in preparation for his first full professional year in 2024," Cherington said.</p>

<h2>Olivia Dunne spotted at Skenes' games</h2>
<p>LSU gymnast and social media personality Olivia Dunne has been spotted in the minor league games of Skenes with both the Single-A Bradenton Marauders and the Double-A Altoona Curve last month.</p>
<p>Skenes&nbsp;&nbsp;that he is in a relationship with the popular 20-year-old college athlete.</p>
<p>Dunne&nbsp;&nbsp;highest-paid female college athlete in terms of name, image, and likeness (NIL) earnings with $3.2 million, which is also third overall after USC freshman guard Bronny James at $6.1 million and Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders at $3.8 million.</p>
