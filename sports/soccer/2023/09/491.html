					(Photo : CARL DE SOUZA/AFP via Getty Images) Brazil's forward Neymar celebrates after scoring a goal during the 2026 FIFA World Cup South American qualifiers football match between Brazil and Bolivia at the Jornalista Edgar Proença 'Mangueirao' stadium, in Belem, state of Para, Brazil, on September 8, 2023. Neymar became Brazil's all-time top scorer on Friday surpassing Pele's record.
				<p>Neymar Jr.&nbsp;, breaking a tie with legend Pele to become the all-time top scorer of the Brazilian national team&nbsp;&nbsp;5-1 win over Bolivia in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on Friday, September 8.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old netted his 78th goal for Brazil with a low cross from a short distance in the 61st minute and scored another one during injury time to put his tally at 79 goals in 125 appearances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neymar had equaled Pele's 77 goals for the country since the 2022 FIFA World Cup, scoring the record-tying strike during Brazil's quarterfinal loss against Croatia on December 8. Pele passed away on December 29 of the same year.</p>
<p>It took a while for Neymar to score the record-breaking goal after he suffered an ankle injury during a PSG game in March, which caused him to miss the rest of the 2022-23 season.</p>

<h2>Not all Brazilians are happy</h2>
<p>Despite the historic achievement,&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Brazil's football confederation still considers Pele the national team's top scorer with 95 goals in 114 appearances, counting the three-time World Cup winner's goal in friendly matches.</p>
<p>FIFA did not include 18 goals in their official tally, and some were against tough European club sides.</p>
<p>Brazilian media outlets were also lukewarm to the idea, and they still appraise Pele as Selecao's all-time top scorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the dispute, Pele's social media team&nbsp;&nbsp;Neymar for his achievement.</p>
