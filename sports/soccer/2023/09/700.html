					(Photo : David Ramos/Getty Images) BARCELONA, SPAIN - Head Coach Xavi Hernandez of FC Barcelona looks on during the La Liga Santander match between FC Barcelona and Cadiz CF at Spotify Camp Nou on February 19, 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.
				<p>FC Barcelona&nbsp;&nbsp;they have renewed the contract of their manager, Xavi Hernandez, for the short-term.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old will continue to manage his boyhood club until the end of the 2024-25 season at least,&nbsp;&nbsp;to prolong the deal until the 2025-26 season.</p>
<p>Xavi took over the helm in November 2021 on an initial agreement until June 2024, replacing Ronald Koeman after the club endured some of its worst seasons in recent memory due to mismanagement by the former board of directors and the departure of their most outstanding player, Lionel Messi.</p>
<p>The former player reversed the fortunes of the Spanish giants, leading them to their first trophy in nearly two years in February 2023, winning the Spanish Super Cup against eternal rivals Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Xavi also mentored the club to their first La Liga title in the 2022-23 season, their first league title since 2018-19.</p>
<p>The Spanish manager&nbsp;&nbsp;Barcelona in 96 games, achieving 61 wins, 16 draws, and 19 losses.</p>

<h2>Xavi - a Barcelona legend</h2>
<p>Before his managerial career, Xavi spent 24 years as a player for Barcelona, entering the club's youth academy La Masia in 1991 as an 11-year-old.</p>
<p>Xavi was able to break through the first team in 1998 and, from there on, established himself as one of the greatest midfielders of all time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He left the club after winning the continental treble with Barca in 2014/15 as the team captain.</p>
