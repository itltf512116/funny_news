					(Photo : Valerio Pennicino/Getty Images) TURIN, ITALY - Paul Pogba of Juventus runs with the ball during the UEFA Europa League semi-final first leg match between Juventus and Sevilla FC at Allianz Stadium on May 11, 2023 in Turin, Italy. 
				<p>Juventus star Paul Pogba&nbsp;&nbsp;for testing positive for a banned substance on Monday,&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The Italian Anti-Doping Organization (Nado Italia) found elevated testosterone levels in the 30-year-old's system after a test was performed during Juventus' 3-0 season-opening win in Serie A against Udinese on August 20.</p>
<p>Nado Italia said that the France international&nbsp;&nbsp;after the substances found were "non-endogenous testosterone metabolites," meaning that the testosterone was not of internal origin.</p>
<p>The tribunal added that the results were "consistent with the exogenous origin of the target compounds," confirming that the extra testosterone levels found were from an external source.</p>
<p>The midfielder has three days to produce a counter-analysis of the results to Nado Italia. Pogba did not play during the season opener.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Paul Pogba risks multi-year ban from football</h2>
<p>Pogba is now waiting for the results of the B sample test. If found guilty of doping,&nbsp;&nbsp;ranging from two to four years.</p>
<p>The 2018 FIFA World Cup winner's contract with Juventus lasts until 2026.</p>
<p>Pogba was once the most expensive player in the world after Premier League club Manchester United&nbsp;&nbsp;$110 million to re-acquire him from Juventus.</p>
<p>He was formerly a Red Devils player, having entered the club's academy in 2009 and played under Sir Alex Ferguson until 2012.</p>
<p>Pogba has since returned to Juventus in July 2022.</p>
