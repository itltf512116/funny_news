					(Photo : Julio Aguilar/Getty Images) TAMPA, FLORIDA - Kyle Rudolph (#8) of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers looks on from the sideline during the second half of a preseason NFL football game against the Miami Dolphins at Raymond James Stadium on August 13, 2022 in Tampa, Florida.
				<p>Veteran NFL tight end Kyle Rudolph&nbsp;&nbsp;his retirement from the sport.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old has played in the league for 12 seasons, and he also said that he would embark on a career in media,&nbsp;&nbsp;as a Big Ten analyst for&nbsp;<em>Peacock</em>&nbsp;and co-host a Sunday night show on&nbsp;<em>FOX Sports</em>&nbsp;radio this fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I played for so long and earned a veteran status, now I'm a rookie getting as many reps as I can in the media world. This off-season is about, 'Where do I fit in?' The&nbsp;<em>NBC</em>&nbsp;job doing games on Peacock is cool. And talking about the storylines of the day in the NFL on Sunday nights will be cool, too," Rudolph&nbsp;&nbsp;sportswriter Peter King of&nbsp;<em>NBC Sports</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 33-year-old also admitted that having four young children was a factor in his decision, with twins in the first grade and two children under five.</p>
<p>Rudolph was selected in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft with the 43rd overall pick by the Minnesota Vikings.</p>
<p>He spent the majority of his career in Minnesota, playing for them until the 2020 season. He moved to the New York Giants for the 2021 campaign while spending the last season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>
<p>Rudolph was a Pro Bowl selection in 2012 and 2017.</p>

<h2>Rudolph, part of NFL history</h2>
<p>The former Notre Dame Fighting Irish&nbsp;&nbsp;final regular season touchdown pass of legendary NFL quarterback Tom Brady.</p>
<p>Rudolph caught an 8-yard pass from Brady during the Buccaneers' Week 18 game against the Atlanta Falcons.</p>
