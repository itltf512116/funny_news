					(Photo : Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images) PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA - Malcolm Brogdon (#13) of the Boston Celtics talks to the media after game three of the Eastern Conference Second Round Playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers at Wells Fargo Center on May 05, 2023 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
				<p>Boston Celtics guard Malcolm Brogdon&nbsp;&nbsp;with the team.</p>
<p>In an appearance in the&nbsp;<em>Celtics Beat podcast,</em>&nbsp;Celtics writer Gary Washburn of&nbsp;<em>The Boston Globe&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;the 30-year-old was "pissed" that the team tried to trade him over the offseason in an attempt to land big man Kristaps Porzingis, and the guard&nbsp;&nbsp;all summer long.</p>
<p>"Malcolm (Brogdon) is the one I'm concerned about, too, because we've heard nothing, and he's angry with the team. So, I don't think communication between the two sides has been fruitful," Washburn said.</p>
<p>The journalist speculated that the reigning 2023 NBA Sixth Man of the Year could hold off getting surgery for his right elbow as a response and protest to the organization's attempt to trade him.</p>

<h2>Concerns about elbow injury canceled offseason trade</h2>
<p>The Celtics were supposed to trade Brogdon to the Los Angeles Clippers as part of a three-team trade that would land them 2018 NBA All-Star Kristaps Porzingis.</p>
<p>However, the Clippers raised concerns over the 6-foot-4 guard's right elbow injury, which caused the deal to be called off.</p>
<p>"It's a partial tear of a tendon, I don't know the name of the tendon but it's coming out of my elbow. Unfortunately, you use it a lot to shoot. So, when I'm shooting, I'm having a lot of pain,"&nbsp;&nbsp;after they were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Finals last May.&nbsp;</p>
