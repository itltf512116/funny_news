<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Kansas City Chiefs quarterback broke his silence regarding the restructuring of his original contract with the team.</p>
<p>"Thank you God!," the two-time NFL Most Valuable Player posted on&nbsp;X, formerly Twitter.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you God! üôèüèΩ</p>&mdash; Patrick Mahomes II (@PatrickMahomes) </blockquote>

<p>The 28-year-old and the Super Bowl champions &nbsp;his current contract with the team, with Mahomes receiving $210.6 million from 2023 to 2026, fully guaranteed, &nbsp;league insider Adam Schefter of <em>ESPN</em>.</p>
<p>The restructured agreement gives Mahomes the most money in NFL history over the course of four seasons.</p>
<p>The two sides will also revisit the contract after 2026, which gives the five-time Pro Bowl selection a chance for a bigger payday in the future.</p>

<h2>Mahomes' record deal took a step back</h2>
<p>The reigning Super Bowl MVP &nbsp;10-year contract extension with the Chiefs worth $450 million in 2020, which could reach up to $503 million if Mahomes delivers various incentives.</p>
<p>The deal remains the biggest American sports contract in terms of total value today and the third largest overall.</p>
<p>However, the length of the pact diminishes its annual average value (AAV), and this offseason, &nbsp;broke the record of the NFL's highest-paid player in history in terms of AAV, all of them quarterbacks - Jalen Hurts of the Philadelphia Eagles, Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens, Justin Herbert of the Los Angeles Chargers, and Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
<p>Mahomes' deal dropped to eighth among all quarterbacks in AAV, but the restructured deal with a $52.65 million AAV propels him back to second, just after Herbert.</p>
