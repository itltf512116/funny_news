					(Photo : JAM STA ROSA/AFP via Getty Images) China's Kaier Li (L) blocks the ball from Serbia's Borisa Simanic (R) during the FIBA Basketball World Cup group B match between China and Serbia at Smart Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City on August 26, 2023. 
				<p>Serbia power forward Borisa Simanic&nbsp;&nbsp;during their final group stage game against South Sudan last Wednesday at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, Philippines.</p>
<p>While the Serbians won the game, 115-83, Simanic lost a vital body organ&nbsp;&nbsp;by South Sudanese forward Nuni Omot with less than two minutes remaining in the lopsided game.</p>
<p>Ormot struck the 25-year-old with his left elbow in the kidney area&nbsp;&nbsp;inside the paint for a layup, which he scored.</p>
<p>While an initial statement by the Serbian Basketball Federation (KSS) said that the kidney and all its functions were preserved, a new report states otherwise.</p>
<p>According&nbsp;, Simanic lost one kidney due to the incident as he underwent surgery in Manila, and it is unclear how this development will affect his career and overall health.</p>

<h2>Nuni Omot responds</h2>
<p>Omot, the 28-year-old who delivered the elbow to Simanic, broke his silence on the incident.</p>
<p>"I heard that he ended up going to the hospital. My apologies, I didn't mean to make no type of a dirty play. I hope you have a speedy recovery. I pray for you, you'll be in my prayers," Omot said.</p>
<p>The South Sudanese player reiterated that he has never been a dirty player, and he sincerely apologized to everyone who was watching, especially the Serbian big man.</p>
