					(Photo : NICOLAS TUCAT/AFP via Getty Images) This photograph taken on August 31, 2023, shows the UEFA Champions League football trophy cup during the ceremony for the draw of the UEFA Champions League football tournament 2023-2024 at The Grimaldi Forum in the Principality of Monaco. 
				<p>The UEFA Champions League&nbsp;&nbsp;group stage earlier today, with the top clubs of Europe vying for the continent's most prestigious trophy.</p>
<p>During the annual event, one "group of death" is usually formed, featuring several top clubs in a single group.</p>
<p>This year,&nbsp;&nbsp;Group F, which has Paris Saint-Germian (PSG), Borussia Dortmund, AC Milan, and Newcastle United.</p>
<p>PSG is the dominant club in France, having won nine of the last 11 Ligue 1 titles. Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga last season, losing the title on the final matchday after leading the league for a significant amount of time during the year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AC Milan won the Serie A in 2021-22, but they are still formidable despite failing to defend their title last season.</p>
<p>Newcastle is making their return to the top European competition after finishing fourth in the Premier League last season amid a takeover of the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund.</p>

<h2>Erling Haaland wins another accolade</h2>
<p>One day after winning the PFA Mens Players' Player of the Year, the Norweigan striker for Manchester City&nbsp;&nbsp;award.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old won the 2022-23 UEFA Men's Player of the Year,&nbsp;&nbsp;Lionel Messi, who played for Paris Saint-Germain last season, and teammate Kevin De Bruyne.</p>
<p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola won the 2022-23 UEFA Men's Coach of the Year after becoming the first manager to win the continental treble twice, previously doing it in 2008-09 in his first season as a full-time manager for FC Barcelona.</p>
