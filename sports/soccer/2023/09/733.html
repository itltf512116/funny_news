					(Photo : Lewis Storey/Getty Images) MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - Marcus Rashford of Manchester United looks on during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Brighton & Hove Albion at Old Trafford on September 16, 2023 in Manchester, England. 
				<p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford&nbsp;&nbsp;a car accident on Saturday, September 24.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incident occurred around late evening&nbsp;&nbsp;against Burnley, as Rashford was departing from the club's Carrington training ground in his white Rolls Royce worth over $850,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A club representative confirmed that the 25-year-old was not injured and what happened was an accidental collision.</p>
<p>"It was an incident involving his car and one driven by a member of the public. Thankfully both were uninjured and no ambulance was required," the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported that Rashford emerged from the car without assistance after the collision. The striker's initial concern was for the well-being of the 74-year-old female motorist in the other vehicle, ensuring that she was not injured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The woman was on her way home from baby&shy;sitting her granddaughter. She was not a football fan and did not recognize the Manchester United star.</p>

<h2>Rashford's teammate rushed to help&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, who scored the only goal in their win earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp;because he saw his teammate on the scene. Understandably, he was also concerned about the woman.</p>
<p>The Portuguese midfielder ensured that both parties involved in the incident were in good condition and could depart from the scene without any issues.</p>
<p>Manchester United's club doctor examined Rashford and assisted the grandmother.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, club representatives arranged and covered the cost of a taxi to transport her safely 15 miles to her residence.&nbsp;</p>
