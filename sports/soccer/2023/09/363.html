					(Photo : Michael Regan/Getty Images) MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - Manchester City's Pep Guardiola and Kyle Walker show appreciation to the fans as they were presented with the Trophy for winning the league following the Premier League match against Everton at Etihad Stadium on May 23, 2021 in Manchester, England. 
				<p>Manchester City right-back Kyle Walker&nbsp;&nbsp;leaving the treble winners this past summer in favor of German giants Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>However, the 33-year-old revealed that Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola&nbsp;&nbsp;that convinced him to stay in England and continue his seven-year spell with the squad in blue.</p>
<p>"We've got a really good relationship and he was kind enough to invite me out for food. He paid the bill for once!," Walker said.</p>
<p>The England international considered leaving the club after losing the starting place at the right back position last season, including in the UEFA Champions League Final against Inter Milan last June.</p>
<p>Despite the demotion, the Spanish manager assured Walker that he still has a big role in Manchester City's squad as they are set to defend the three major titles they won in 2022-23.</p>

<h2>The new deal is yet to be official</h2>
<p>While no deal has been officially announced yet, Walker&nbsp;&nbsp;he will sign an extension with the European champions until 2026.</p>
<p>"In the back of my head, I always wanted to play for Manchester City, but I had to do what was right for me and my future," said Walker, the current club captain in the absence of Kevin De Bruyne.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He admitted choosing Manchester City because they gave him a more extended contract, which bodes well for long-term financial security.</p>
