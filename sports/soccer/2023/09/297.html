<p>The Ukrainian&nbsp;&nbsp;for his seventh team in six seasons since the Los Angeles Lakers drafted him with the 47th overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old spent the first months of his rookie season playing with the purple and gold franchise, wherein he was teammates with the NBA's all-time leading scorer, LeBron James.</p>
<p>Mykhailiuk was eventually traded midseason to the Detroit Pistons, where he spent nearly two years. Stints&nbsp;&nbsp;Oklahoma City Thunder and the Toronto Raptors followed.</p>
