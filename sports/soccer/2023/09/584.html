<p>"In the second half, we went three and out a couple times and they had a sack on I think on the first drive of the second half. They made some plays on defense. The reality is that we got to be better and we should have won that game," the nine-time Pro Bowl selection added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, head coach Sean Payton &nbsp;something similar, saying they must be better. However, some of his post-game comments were seemingly directed at Wilson.</p>
