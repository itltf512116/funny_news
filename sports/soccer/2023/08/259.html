<p>Jones is seeking a lucrative contract extension, and &nbsp;to hold out until Week 8 of their title defense campaign.</p>
<p>The two-time Super Bowl winner did not report to training camp, and he could potentially miss out on $7.5 million in-game checks in addition to the $50,000 daily fine he was meted for his absence in training camp.</p>
<p>Jones was selected to his fourth Pro Bowl game in a row and the First Team All-Pro for the first time last season.</p>
<p>He registered a career-high 15.5 sacks last year, helping the Chiefs win their second Super Bowl in four seasons last February.</p>
<p>The former Mississippi State player will enter the final year of a four-year, $80 million contract that he signed in 2020 to stay in Kansas City.</p>
