					(Photo : Marcelo Endelli/Getty Images) BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA - Lionel Messi of Argentina celebrates with the FIFA World Cup trophy after an international friendly match between Argentina and Panama at Estadio Más Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti on March 23, 2023 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
				<p>Argentine football icon Lionel Messi is widely regarded to be the greatest football player of all time, consistently putting up brilliant individual performances while being part of winning teams at FC Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, his home country Argentina, and most recently, Inter Miami.</p>
<p>The 5-foot-7 forward's on-field success brings a lot of opportunity to add to his bank account. With that being said, how much exactly is Lionel Messi's net worth in 2023?</p>
<h2>Lionel Messi Net Worth 2023</h2>
<p>The 36-year-old Messi&nbsp;&nbsp;a staggering $600 million,&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Celebrity Net Worth</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Goal</em>.</p>
<p>With association football being the world's most popular sport, the demand for the very best players is high and lucrative.</p>
<p>Messi has been in the top three highest-paid athletes annually by&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;since 2016, topping the list in 2019 and 2022. He was listed as second&nbsp;, earning $130 million, slightly behind career rival Cristiano Ronaldo's $136 million.</p>
<h2>Lionel Messi's Record Contract</h2>
<p>Messi&nbsp;&nbsp;largest contract in sports history after his boyhood club, FC Barcelona, signed him to a four-year extension in 2017 worth $673 million.</p>
<p>However, the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner&nbsp;&nbsp;the full amount after agreeing to a 70 percent pay cut during the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the club to suffer crippling financial losses and debt.</p>
<p>The Spanish club's financial crisis was also the main reason they couldn't renew Messi's record-setting contract when it expired in 2021, causing him to move to French club Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
<p>Barcelona&nbsp;&nbsp;Messi for his deferred wages, which will last until 2025.</p>
<p>Messi spent the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons with PSG,&nbsp;&nbsp;$41 million annually, including add-ons.</p>

<h2>Lionel Messi Refused Billion Dollar Offer</h2>
<p>Messi decided to leave the French capital at the end of the 2022-23 campaign, with several clubs interested in the services of the six-time European Golden Shoe winner.</p>
<p>The recent World Cup winner was linked to a return to Barcelona, but complications stemming from the club's financial situation made the signing difficult.</p>
<p>Messi said that he would not want to continue playing in Europe if it wasn't for Barcelona, and two teams outside of the continent made their pitch.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal made an initial offer of $1.3 billion for three years&nbsp;&nbsp;the amount to $1.6 billion after the all-time leading scorer for both FC Barcelona and Argentina refused the initial proposal.</p>
<p>Instead, Messi chose to sign with American club Inter Miami of the MLS for a much lower upfront amount, but will give him a chance to earn much more money in the long run.</p>
<p>The former Barca and PSG forward&nbsp;&nbsp;earn $60 million per season in a two-and-a-half-year contract worth $150 million, including bonuses.</p>
<p>The other sweet financial spot of Messi's Miami move does not lie with the club but with Apple and Adidas.</p>
<p>The two companies will give the Argentine a portion of profits generated from Apple's MLS Season Pass and jersey and merchandise sales from Adidas as part of the pitch to convince him to play in the United States.</p>
<p>Messi&nbsp;&nbsp;a lifetime contract with the German sportswear brand, which he signed in 2017.</p>
