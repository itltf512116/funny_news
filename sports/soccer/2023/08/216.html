					(Photo : Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images) MADRID, SPAIN - Spanish FA president Luis Rubiales attends a reception to the Spanish women’s national football team at Moncloa Palace after they won the Australia and New Zealand FIFA Women's World Cup 2023.
				<p>Spanish Football Federation (REFF) president Luis Rubiales finds himself in an even deeper mess following the controversial kiss that he did to Jenni Hermoso.</p>
<p>All the players who were part of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup triumph have reportedly&nbsp;&nbsp;for their country again for as long as Rubiales remains at the helm,&nbsp;<em>ESPN</em>&nbsp;reported.</p>
<p>This came about on Friday, August 25, after Hermoso released a&nbsp;with her union, FUTPRO, denying the claim of Rubiales that she had consented to the controversial kiss that has created widespread scandal during Spain's World Cup final celebrations.</p>

<p>"I want to clarify, as you can see in the images, that at no time did I consent to the kiss that he gave me," Hermoso said. "I won't tolerate that my word is called into question, and even less so that words are invented which I didn't say."</p>
<p>The statement was co-signed by all the members of Spain's World Cup squad and 58 former players.</p>
<p>This adds more pressure to Rubiales as calls for him to step down continue.</p>
<p>For his part, the 46-year-old Spanish football official branded these attacks as&nbsp;social assassination by false feminists&nbsp;in a speech to the RFEF's general assembly, which he .</p>
<p>The controversy has placed a notable dent in the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup win of Spain, with Hermoso and her teammates standing pat on not playing for the country until current management remains at the RFEF.</p>
<p>The Spain Sports Council (CSD) confirmed that it seeks to remove Rubiales by bringing a complaint to the country's Administrative Sports Court (TAD).</p>
