				<p>Spanish Football Federation (REFF) president Luis Rubiales finds himself in an even deeper mess following the controversial kiss that he did to Jenni Hermoso.</p>
<p>All the players who were part of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup triumph have reportedly&nbsp;&nbsp;for their country again for as long as Rubiales remains at the helm,&nbsp;<em>ESPN</em>&nbsp;reported.</p>
<p>This came about on Friday, August 25, after Hermoso released a&nbsp;with her union, FUTPRO, denying the claim of Rubiales that she had consented to the controversial kiss that has created widespread scandal during Spain's World Cup final celebrations.</p>

<p>"I want to clarify, as you can see in the images, that at no time did I consent to the kiss that he gave me," Hermoso said. "I won't tolerate that my word is called into question, and even less so that words are invented which I didn't say."</p>

<p>The Spain Sports Council (CSD) confirmed that it seeks to remove Rubiales by bringing a complaint to the country's Administrative Sports Court (TAD).</p>
