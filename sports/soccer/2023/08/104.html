					(Photo : Gareth Copley/Getty Images) MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - Harry Maguire of Manchester United warms up prior to the Premier League match between Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers at Old Trafford on August 14, 2023, in Manchester, England. 
				<p>Harry Maguire&nbsp;&nbsp;Manchester United's iconic red shirt after all, according to multiple reports.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old was supposed to move to West Ham United, where the East London club was slated to pay $38 million to acquire the services of the defender. The two clubs agreed in principle, but the player rejected the transfer in favor of staying in Manchester.</p>
<p>West Ham United is still looking for replacements to fill the void left by defensive midfielder Declan Rice, whom they sold to fellow London club Arsenal for a British record fee of $127 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sources told Rob Dawson of&nbsp;<em>ESPN&nbsp;</em>that Manchester United is still open to inquiries for the defender, but manager Erik ten Hag guaranteed Maguire that there is a place for him in the team.</p>
<p>Maguire was named on the bench but did not play during the Red Devils' Premier League season opener against the Wolves, which resulted in a 1-0 victory.</p>
<p>The England defender is&nbsp;&nbsp;to fight for a spot in Manchester United's loaded backline, which includes Victor Lindelof, Rapha&euml;l Varane, and Lisandro Martinez.</p>
<p>Maguire's contract with Manchester United runs until the conclusion of the 2024-25 season. He is reportedly earning about $250,000 per week.</p>
<p>Sources close to the player&nbsp;&nbsp;Maguire respects West Ham and their manager David Moyes, but there was never an agreement on personal terms.</p>
<p>"Harry remains settled at United, loves the club and believes he will get plenty of opportunities to play," a source mentioned to Italian football journalist Fabrizio Romano.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>An eventful summer break for Harry Maguire</h2>
<p>The 6-foot-4 center-back has had an eventful summer so far, which started when&nbsp;&nbsp;of the captaincy duties of Manchester United last month.</p>
<p>Maguire previously assumed the captaincy in January 2020 after the departure of Ashley Young, and he has lifted the 2020-21 UEFA Europa League and the 2022-23 Carabao Cup while wearing the captain's armband.</p>
<p>However, ten Hag was looking for a change in scenery concerning leadership in the team. Portuguese midfielder Bruno Fernandes was soon named the new club captain, with Maguire congratulating the 28-year-old for succeeding him.</p>
<p>Maguire played for Leicester City from 2017 to 2019, and Manchester United paid a record $104 million transfer fee to acquire Maguire in August 2019. The figure made Maguire the most expensive defender in the world, which still stands today.</p>
<p>After a promising first season, wherein he was promoted to club captain five months after his arrival, controversies started to pile up for the England international. He was arrested on the Greek island of Mykonos in August 2020 after an altercation with the police.</p>
<p>A decline in performance resulted in Maguire only making eight starts in the Premier League last season.</p>
