					(Photo : OLI SCARFF/AFP via Getty Images) Manchester City's Spanish manager Pep Guardiola (L) gestures to Manchester City's Portuguese defender Joao Cancelo (R) during the English Premier League football match between Newcastle United and Manchester City at St James' Park in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, north east England on December 19, 2021.

<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>FC Barcelona successfully hit &nbsp;for the summer transfer window, with a few days to spare until the window closes.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üö® Jo√£o Cancelo is the main target for FC Barcelona this summer, but if it becomes complicated, the alternatives are: Foyth, Meunier &amp; Dalot. [üéñÔ∏è] </p>&mdash; Managing Bar√ßa (@ManagingBarca) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>The defending La Liga champions &nbsp;to acquire full-back Joao Cancelo on loan from treble winners Manchester City, with an option to buy the Portuguese on a permanent transfer next year for a fee in the region of $27 million, according to <em>The Guardian</em>.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old will be traveling to Barcelona within the day to complete the signing, &nbsp;football journalist Fabrizio Romano.</p>
<p>Cancelo has been regarded as one of the best full-backs in the world, but he missed the treble-winning season of Manchester City after he was loaned out to German club Bayern Munich in January 2023 until the end of the season.</p>

<h2>Joao Cancelo's falling out with Pep Guardiola</h2>
<p>Spanish manager Pep Guardiola benched Cancelo towards the end of 2022 after impressive performances by other defenders in the team.</p>
<p>Guardiola was disappointed with how Cancelo handled his decreased playing time, &nbsp;with the full-back wearing earphones during a team talk and refusing to listen to the two-time treble-winning manager.</p>
<p>Barcelona was already interested in Cancelo in January, but manager Xavi said that Manchester City officials blocked the Portuguese's move to Spain, opting to ship him to Munich.</p>
<p>Cancelo was an integral member of Manchester City's Premier League-winning squads since his arrival in 2019 until his demotion to the bench.</p>
