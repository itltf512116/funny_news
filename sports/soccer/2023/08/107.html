					(Photo : Maddie Meyer/Getty Images) BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr looks on during the first half against the Boston Celtics at TD Garden on January 19, 2023, in Boston, Massachusetts.
				<p>Golden State Warriors and Team USA head coach Steve Kerr&nbsp;&nbsp;La Liga club RCD Mallorca's ownership, becoming a minority stakeholder of the Spanish side, the club announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 57-year-old mentor&nbsp;&nbsp;he is a longtime friend of former tennis player Andy Kohlberg, who is now the club president.</p>
<p>"I'm a friend of Andy Kohlberg and we were talking this summer. He told me about the change in ownership, and offered me the chance to be part of the new investment group. I'm really looking forward to it," Kerr said.</p>
<p>The four-time NBA champion coach visited Mallorca last summer and&nbsp;&nbsp;to the first-team players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kohlberg&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerr joked that the new ownership stake could be an excuse to visit the famous Spanish tourist island every summer.</p>
<p>However, the Warriors tactician could not come this summer because of his head coaching duties with Team USA, who is set to play in the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup from August 25 to September 10, primarily in the Philippines, with some games in Indonesia and Japan.</p>

<h2>Former NBA MVP also part of Mallorca's ownership</h2>
<p>Two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Steve Nash&nbsp;&nbsp;in the club in 2016 alongside former Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver.</p>
<p>Nash played for the Suns for the majority of his career, winning his two MVPs in Phoenix.</p>
<p>Sarver&nbsp;&nbsp;in Mallorca last June to Kohlberg, but Nash kept his stake in the team.</p>
