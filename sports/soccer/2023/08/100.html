					<img title="Neymar Jr. - Cerezo Osaka v Paris Saint-Germain - Preseason Friendly" src="/upload/images/2023/8/caf5f5d2398388af.jpg" alt="Neymar Jr. - Cerezo Osaka v Paris Saint-Germain - Preseason Friendly" />
					(Photo : Kenta Harada/Getty Images) OSAKA, JAPAN - Neymar Jr of Paris Saint-Germain poses for photographs prior to the preseason friendly match between Cerezo Osaka and Paris Saint-Germain at Yanmar Stadium Nagai on July 28, 2023, in Osaka, Japan.
				<p>The best is yet to come for the Saudi Professional League, as they could potentially land their biggest signing of the summer, even after the arrival of reigning Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante, Sadio Mane, and other big names in a star-studded transfer window for clubs in the country.</p>
<p>Riyadh-based club Al-Hilal&nbsp;&nbsp;to bring in Brazil and Paris Saint-Germain star forward Neymar Jr, who expressed his desire to leave the French capital sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>The French club is reportedly asking for $88 million as a transfer fee, and the 31-year-old will receive about $110 million annually as a salary in a two-year contract to play in the oil-rich kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;from Italian football journalist Fabrizio Romano stated that the Saudi Arabian club is preparing the documents to be checked by Neymar's camp by Monday. The forward has already approved his move to the Middle Eastern country.</p>
<p>The Brazilian national football team's joint all-time top scorer, alongside icon Pele, previously expressed his desire to return to his former club, Spanish giants FC Barcelona.</p>
<p>However, the Catalan club is in the midst of a financial crisis and massive debt, which makes them unable to afford both the gargantuan transfer fee and the player's salary despite the Brazilian's willingness to compromise.</p>
<p>Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez also opposes the move, stating that his former teammate does not fit his tactics and plans for the upcoming 2023-24 season, but club officials are divided.</p>
<p>Neymar Jr.'s impending departure from top-tier European football competition during his prime is seen as a disappointment for some after being highly touted to become one of the greatest players of all-time as a prodigy in Brazilian club Santos.</p>

<h2>Al-Hilal tries Neymar after Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe misses</h2>
<p>The Saudi Arabian previously made billion-dollar bids to Neymar's two partners as Paris Saint-Germain's attacking trio for the past two seasons -- Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe.</p>
<p>Al-Hilal&nbsp;&nbsp;of $1.6 billion for Messi as a free agent amid his decision to move away from the French capital after two years. The 36-year-old Argentine icon ultimately chose a move to the United States with MLS club Inter Miami.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Riyadh club&nbsp;&nbsp;during the contract standoff between Kylian Mbappe and PSG.</p>
<p>Al-Hilal proposed a record offer of a $332 million transfer fee to PSG for the rights to the 24-year-old, as well as a $776 million salary for just the 2023-24 season for Mbappe, wherein he would be free to leave and return to European competition after the season.</p>
<p>However, the French international rejected even a sitdown with a delegation from Al-Hilal, clearly sending a message that he does not plan to spend a season in the kingdom.</p>
