					(Photo : Kenta Harada/Getty Images) OSAKA, JAPAN - Neymar Jr of Paris Saint-Germain applaud fans after the pre-season friendly match between Paris Saint-Germain and Al-Nassr at Yanmar Stadium Nagai on July 25, 2023, in Osaka, Japan.

<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal is set to reveal their biggest star signing in club history, and it will come with many perks for the player.</p>
<p>Brazilian star forward Neymar Jr. signed his contract&nbsp;with the Riyadh-based club earlier today, according to Italian football journalist Fabrizio Romano. He also passed his medical tests with all documents ready and completed. The player will travel to the oil-rich kingdom for the official reveal later this week.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Neymar Jr to Al Hilal, deal now signed! All documents are completed — and medical tests were also successfully passed earlier today 🔵🇸🇦<br><br>🛩️ Told Neymar is expected to travel to Saudi later this week, not on Tuesday per current plan.<br><br>Deal sealed, Ney joins Saudi league. </p>&mdash; Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>Paris Saint-Germain &nbsp;a transfer fee of $98.5 million in return, less than half of the world record amount they paid to acquire Neymar in 2017 from FC Barcelona, which was approximately $240 million.</p>
<p>Neymar &nbsp;a lot of insane perks during his impending time in the Saudi Professional League, aside from the estimated $110 million annual salary he will earn in the next two years.</p>
<p>The joint all-time top scorer of the Brazilian national team will have a private plane at his disposal, ready to fly to any destination in the world comfortably and conveniently at any time.</p>
<p>He will also have his fully-furnished mansion, complete with a dedicated staff ready to cater to all the needs of the star signing and his family.</p>
<p>Neymar will also receive additional financial incentives, including an $87,000 bonus for every Al-Hilal victory and $545,000 for every social media post or story promoting Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The popular forward will also be immune from the country's strict laws about cohabitation, and he will be allowed to live with partner Bruna Biancardi even if they are not married. The couple recently announced that they are expecting a baby girl.</p>
<p>Al-Nassr forward Cristiano Ronaldo &nbsp;from the same law, as he lives with his current partner Georgina Rodriguez in one home despite being unmarried since the Portuguese icon moved to the Gulf country earlier this year.</p>
<p>Despite all the perks, Neymar's impending departure from top-tier European competition at 31 years old is generally seen as a disappointment and a failure to reach the massive potential bestowed upon him as a teenage prodigy in Santos.</p>

<h2>Neymar Jr. is the most expensive player ever in combined transfer fees</h2>
<p>The 31-year-old has regained his spot as the player with the highest cumulative transfer fees in his career, surpassing Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku.</p>
<p>Teams &nbsp;$436 million for Neymar throughout his career in three different transactions.</p>
<p>FC Barcelona initially paid Brazilian club Santos $96 million to acquire the then 21-year-old prodigy in 2013 in the player's first foray into European football.</p>
<p>Paris Saint-Germain's world record $242 million fee was the next transaction involving the forward, which came in the summer of 2017. Lastly, the $98 million fee that Al-Hilal paid to PSG puts Neymar over Lukaku in the overall transfer fee ranking.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, teams &nbsp;almost $370 million on Lukaku in six transfers.</p>
