					(Photo : Stacy Revere/Getty Images) MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN - Giannis Antetokounmpo (#34) of the Milwaukee Bucks watches action from the sideline during the first half of a game against the Toronto Raptors at Fiserv Forum on January 17, 2023, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokoumpo might be ready to switch sports and take his talents to the oil-rich Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>About a month after the two-time NBA MVP offered himself to Saudi Arabian football club Al-Hilal, the club presented&nbsp;Antetokounmpo with his customized jersey bearing his name and number alongside a package with a welcome card.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your jersey is ready   <br><br>Welcome ‚ÄúGIANNIS‚Äù to our family üîµ‚ö™Ô∏è üíô </p>&mdash; AlHilal Saudi Club (@Alhilal_EN) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>The Riyadh-based club shared photos of the welcome package in their English account on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.</p>
<p>The 2021 NBA Finals MVP &nbsp;himself to Al-Hilal nearly a month ago after &nbsp;about the Saudi Professional League club offering French football star Kylian Mbappe a single-season salary of $776 million for the 2023-24 campaign, coupled with a $332 million transfer fee to be paid to his current club Paris Saint-Germain amid a contract standoff between the 24-year-old and the French club.</p>
<p>Mbappe &nbsp;Antetokounmpo's proposal amusing, quoting the tweet with a barrage of laughing emojis.</p>
<p>Al-Hilal previously offered a three-year contract worth $1.6 billion to Argentine icon Lionel Messi, which he rejected in favor of a move to MLS club Inter Miami.</p>
<p>The club subsequently turned its attention to Mbappe, who also rejected even a sitdown with club delegates, before finally convincing the third member of PSG's strikeforce for the past two seasons, Neymar Jr., &nbsp;the team earlier this week.</p>
<p>Antetokounmpo celebrated Al-Hilal's acquisition of the Brazilian star forward by calling himself and Neymar the best duo in the Saudi Pro League, &nbsp;of them together, which was taken in early 2020 when the Bucks visited Paris for the NBA Global Games, where they defeated the Charlotte Hornets.</p>

<h2>Antetokounmpo's contract with the Bucks is not cheap</h2>
<p>Despite being enamored with the riches that several Saudi Arabian clubs offer, Antetokoumpo probably does not need money.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old &nbsp;a five-year supermax extension with the Milwaukee Bucks worth $228 million in late 2020. The deal took effect in the 2021-22 NBA season, and it will keep the seven-time All-Star tied in Milwaukee until at least 2024-25, with 2025-26 being a player option.</p>
<p>Antetokoumpo was the seventh highest-paid player in the league last season, and his current deal &nbsp;NBA contract of all time in terms of overall value as of 2023, according to <em>Boardroom</em>.</p>
<p>So far, the 7-foot Greek &nbsp;of $190 million, and he is still set to make $146 million over the next three seasons as part of his Bucks contract.</p>
<p>American sportswear giant Nike &nbsp;Antetokounmpo to a long-term deal in 2017, which was reported to have paid the Greek around $10 million annually.</p>
<p>Nike has released five editions of the Bucks star's "Zoom Freak" signature line and a secondary shoe line called "Giannis Immortality."</p>
<p>Giannis' Nike shoes &nbsp;the most popular sneakers worn by players in the league today.</p>
