            <p>West Ham United has become the next club to conduct major changes in their front office after co-chair Vanessa Gold announced that her family plans&nbsp;in the club.</p>
<p>The announcement came when several Premier League clubs already&nbsp;&nbsp;in their management.</p>

<p>"I would consider selling a proportion of our shares to the right partner," Gold said in a statement published on the club's website.</p>
<p>"I have spoken to each of the other three major shareholders at West Ham United, David Sullivan, Daniel Křet&iacute;nsk&yacute; and Tripp Smith, who have been very supportive. Any transaction to purchase some of our shares will be with my father's legacy at the forefront of my mind which, of course, prioritizes his beloved West Ham United."</p>
<p>The Gold family is the third largest shareholder in the club, owning 25.1 percent, next to billionaire David Sullivan, who owns 38.8 percent, and Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, who owns 27 percent.</p>
<h2>Qatari billionaire plans to sweep in</h2>
<p>Gold said her family will only sell a proportion of their stake, but it is believed that what's up for sale is much bigger than initially reported.</p>
<p>One investor&nbsp;&nbsp;is Qatar Emir Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Than, who previously tried to take over Manchester United but failed.</p>
<p>West Ham United, in general, is not doing that bad, whether financially or on the field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They won the Europa League last season and sit in ninth place in the Premier League table.</p>
<p>They also increased the capacity of their home ground, the London Stadium, to 62,500 in an attempt to grow its fan base.</p>
