					(Photo : Michael Regan/Getty Images) NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, ENGLAND - Kylian Mbappe of Paris Saint-Germain on the ball as Miguel Almiron of Newcastle United looks on during the UEFA Champions League match between Newcastle United FC and Paris Saint-Germain at St. James Park on October 04, 2023 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England.
				<p>Newcastle United have shown in the Champions League that they can compete with anybody &nbsp;in the Group Stage.</p>
<p>Will that be enough to sign superstars, especially now that they are the &nbsp;in terms of financial backing?</p>
<p>One player linked to the club is Kylian Mbappe, who was stunned by the retooled Magpies.</p>

<p>English football journalist Luke Edwards recently revealed that although Newcastle has the money, the &nbsp;remains unreachable.</p>
<p>"I would love to see him at Newcastle, to be honest, Dan Burn feeding him balls would be a great prospect," Edwards said in a <em>BBC</em>&nbsp;podcast.</p>
<p>"I'm sure Newcastle fans would as well, but everything we hear about, they just can't afford the wages. The highest earner at Newcastle is on about &pound;150,000-a-week, and Mbappe would be looking in excess of &pound;400,000-a-week, so he's a bit out of their price range."</p>
<h2>Mbappe's connection with Newcastle</h2>
<p>The October 5 game was the first time Mbappe visited the Magpies, but he already knew about Newcastle.</p>
<p>The chances of him signing with them might not be that high, not because of how the Premier League club punished PSG but because of the hot weather.</p>
<p>A video of Mbappe with the France national football team surfaced wherein Antoine Griezmann teased him about being sent to Newcastle.</p>
<p>His response was: "It's not warm there, huh?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>January window will arrive soon, and Newcastle will need to beef up its roster if ever they reach the knockout rounds. If not Mbappe, who will they sign?</p>
