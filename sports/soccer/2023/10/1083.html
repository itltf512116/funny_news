            <p>Former England national football team member Jamie Carragher earned the ire of Aaron Ramsdale's father almost a month ago after making fun of the Arsenal player who fell deep in the depth chart of Mikel Arteta's squad.</p>
<p>During a broadcast, Carragher&nbsp;&nbsp;about Ramsdale, saying he is only playing for the camera. The latter's dad called him a disgrace in return.</p>

<p>While Ramsdale was not offended, he&nbsp; that being replaced by the 25-year-old David Raya from the starting spot hurt.</p>
<p>"We push each other in training and there's days where I come in and I'm down because of the situation and he picks me up," Ramsdale said.</p>
<p>"And for whatever reason, there might be a day where he's down and even though I'm suffering and hurting for not playing, I have to stand up and be able to push him."</p>
<h2>What does Arteta think of Ramsdale?</h2>
<p>Ramsdale said his job is always to be ready when he gets called up, and he proved that he is indeed prepared when Arteta chose him in a win against Brentford in the EFL Cup.</p>
<p>The Spanish manager was&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"We love him, for sure," he said of Ramsdale after the 1-0 victory.</p>
<p>"We know his character and what he brings to the team and we are happy to have him. Every player is very important. Today he had the opportunity to play and he had a really good game."</p>
<p>Ramsdale and Arsenal will return to club action for Round 9 this weekend.</p>
