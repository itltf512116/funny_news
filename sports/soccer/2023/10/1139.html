<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The Atlanta Braves &nbsp;after being eliminated in the 2023 MLB Playoffs in the National League Division Series by the Philadelphia Phillies in four games earlier this month.</p>
<p>The Braves they had re-signed relief pitcher Pierce Johnson to a two-year contract worth $14.25 million.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="qme" dir="ltr">✍️✍️✍️ </p>&mdash; Atlanta Braves (@Braves) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>The 32-year-old was initially expected to become a free agent at the end of the ongoing postseason. He is now slated to earn $7 million in both the 2024 and 2025 MLB seasons, with a club option for 2026 and a $250,000 buyout.</p>
<p>Johnson was acquired by the Braves in a trade with the Colorado Rockies last July for minor league pitchers Victor Vodnik and Tanner Gordon ahead of the recent MLB trade deadline.</p>
<p>The right-hander revitalized his season after losing the closer's position back in Denver earlier this year.</p>

<h2>Johnson was stellar for Atlanta</h2>
<p>Johnson helped the Braves clinch the best record in baseball in the 2023 regular season with a 104-58 win-loss slate.</p>
<p>During his 24 appearances for the National League East division winners, &nbsp;0.76 ERA, recording 32 strikeouts across 23.2 innings out of the bullpen.</p>
<p>Johnson is pledging to donate 1% of his salary to the Atlanta Braves Foundation. He has previously pitched for the Chicago Cubs, San Francisco Giants, San Diego Padres, and NPB club Hanshin Tigers.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, he has accumulated 12 wins and 15 losses with a 4.04 ERA and secured 13 saves.</p>
