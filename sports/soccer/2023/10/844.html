<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Former NFL player Richard Sherman, who has transitioned into a sports talk show host, &nbsp;controversial opinion concerning Denver Nuggets head coach Michael Malone.</p>
<p>The Super Bowl XLVIII winner blasted the&nbsp;reigning NBA champions' mentor during a recent episode of <em>Undisputed </em>on <em>Fox Sports 1</em>, where he serves as a co-host with sports personality Skip Bayless.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Michael Malone has had one successful season... Michael Malone will be an irrelevant, erroneous name in the history books of the NBA... Enjoy your 15 seconds of fame, talk about LeBron.&quot;<br><br>Richard Sherman takes a shot at the Nuggets&#39; championship coach 😳</p>&mdash; ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>"Michael Malone has one successful season... Michael Malone will be an irrelevant, erroneous name in the history books of the NBA. Enjoy your 15 seconds of fame, talk about LeBron," the 35-year-old told co-hosts Bayless and Keyshawn Johnson.</p>
<p>Sherman added that Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James probably doesn't care much about the 52-year-old tactician.</p>

<h2>Michael Malone sends strong message to the Lakers</h2>
<p>Before Sherman's tirade, the two-time NBA All-Star Game head coach &nbsp;aimed at the Lakers, whom they swept in the recent Western Conference Finals.</p>
<p>"Oh, they're talking about us? That was what, four months ago? I can't speak for anybody in L.A. But if they're still worried about us, that's on them," Malone remarked at the Nuggets' training camp in UC San Diego.</p>
<p>Amid the animosity between the two teams, Malone noted that the upcoming season brings a new set of challenges, and despite the sweep last time, every single game felt like it could have gone either way.</p>
<p>Malone also said he maintains tremendous respect for the Lakers and Darvin Ham as a coach.</p>
