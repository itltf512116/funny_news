					(Photo : Paolo Bruno/Getty Image) ROME, ITALY - Jose Mourinho, Head Coach of AS Roma, speaks with Referee Giovanni Ayroldi during the Serie A TIM match between AS Roma and AC Monza at Stadio Olimpico on October 22, 2023 in Rome, Italy.
				



            <p>Jose Mourinho never shies away from speaking his mind, and his latest one has AS Roma fans divided. And probably his players.</p>
<p>In a game they barely survived, Roma got the three points in their visit to Monza.</p>
<p>However, Mourinho does not think his club deserves the victory, putting them in sixth place in the&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The Portuguese coach thought Monza, who had just been promoted to the Italian top-flight league,&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"I think Monza did not deserve to lose the match," Mourinho told&nbsp;<em>Sky Sport Italia</em>.</p>

<p>Mourinho also commented on the performance of his players, who were busy during the international break, indicating that they came into the match tired.</p>
<p>"Obviously, I am very happy with the points, but I always felt my team was struggling. We made a lot of technical errors, the players were physically drained after long journeys on international duty."</p>
<h2>Mourinho blames Monza bench for his ejection</h2>
<p>While Mourinho praises their weekend opponents, he also blames&nbsp;for the red card that led to him getting sent back to the locker room.</p>
<p>He said the Monza bench behaved in a way that influenced the referee's decision to boot him out.</p>
<p>"I don't know why I got the red card, I only made a gesture to the bench, not a single word," Mourinho said.</p>
<p>"The Monza bench put a lot of pressure on the referee, they shouldn't have behaved like that."</p>
