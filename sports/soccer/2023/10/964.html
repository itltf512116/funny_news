					(Photo : Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)) LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - Ja Morant (#12) of the Memphis Grizzlies warms up before play against the Los Angeles Lakers in Game Six of the Western Conference First Round Playoffs at Crypto.com Arena on April 28, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. 
				<p>Is Ja Morant's 25-game suspension over the gun-toting incident excessive?</p>
<p>The NBA Players Association thought so and appealed to the league to shorten it.</p>
<p>The appeal was listened to, but the NBA maintained that there are still conditions that the Memphis Grizzlies need to meet.</p>
<p>NBA executive vice president Joe Dumars said the league committee is communicating with Morant's camp, but commuting the lengthy suspension is&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"So the 25 games are the 25 games," Dumars told&nbsp;<em>The Athletic</em>.</p>

<p>Dumars added that Morant must stay committed to the game despite being barred from the NBA court.</p>
<p>"But I think for this 24-year-old kid to continue to grow, he needs to continue to practice every day with his team and be around his team and team meetings. And all of that stuff, I think, really helps a young guy's growth. He needs to be in that environment. I would hate for him to just have to go to some gym somewhere because we didn't allow him to practice, just to try to stay in shape, but he's completely isolated from everyone else."</p>
<p>He also clarified that the suspension will not be lengthened anymore.</p>
<h2>What did the NBPA think of the suspension?</h2>
<p>The NBPA previously suggested that the&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;with the punishments handed out to players involved in the same incident.</p>
<p>"We believe it is excessive and inappropriate for a number of reasons including the facts involved in this particular incident, and that it is not fair and consistent with past discipline in our league," it said shortly after the news of Ja's suspension was released.</p>
