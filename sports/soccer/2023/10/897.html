					(Photo : Fran Santiago/Getty Images) GRANADA, SPAIN - Xavi, Head Coach of FC Barcelona reacts during the LaLiga EA Sports match between Granada CF and FC Barcelona at Estadio Nuevo Los Carmenes on October 08, 2023 in Granada, Spain. 
				<p>FC Barcelona nearly pulled off a remarkable comeback in their La Liga fixture against Granada at the Estadio Nuevo Los Carmenes on Sunday, October 8.</p>
<p>However, their efforts&nbsp;&nbsp;2-2 draw, marked by a controversial decision by the officials that disallowed what could have been a game-winning goal for the Blaugrana.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The breakthrough nearly came for Barca when Joao Felix thought he had scored a dramatic late winner in injury time. However, his goal was disallowed due to a marginal offside call against Ferran Torres.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barcelona boss Xavi&nbsp;&nbsp;about the crucial call that prevented them from taking a higher spot in the La Liga table.</p>
<p>"Just as the referee can rule out Jo&atilde;o Felix's goal, he can also give it. I think Torres doesn't interfere, whether Ferran jumps or not, the ball goes to the same place. Who is he interfering with?," the 43-year-old tactician remarked.</p>

<h2>Lamine Yamal makes history</h2>
<p>Trailing by two goals scored by Granada forward Bryan Zaragoza just before halftime, Barcelona's teenage prodigy Lamine Yamal reduced the deficit in injury time, providing a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>The crucial goal&nbsp;&nbsp;- the Spanish winger became the youngest goalscorer in La Liga history with the strike at just 16 years and 87 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Full-back Sergio Roberto then leveled the game in the 85th minute, setting the stage for both teams to scramble for a potential game-winning goal in the match's dying moments.&nbsp;</p>
