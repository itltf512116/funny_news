					(Photo : Matthias Hangst/Getty Images) DORTMUND, GERMANY - OCTOBER 25: Erling Haaland of Manchester City embraces Jude Bellingham of Borussia Dortmund prior to the UEFA Champions League group G match between Borussia Dortmund and Manchester City at Signal Iduna Park on October 25, 2022 in Dortmund, Germany.  
				



            <p>Pep Guardiola and Manchester City have been tearing leagues apart through their consistent form ever since the Spanish coach arrived at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
<p>This should make them a top destination for great young players.</p>
<p>That is not what happened though with England youngster Jude Bellingham who is now&nbsp;.</p>
<p>City's former ace player Sergio Aguero said&nbsp;&nbsp;that his former coach was late in getting the signatures of Jude Bellingham but explained it does happen.</p>

<p>He also took solace from the fact that they got Bellingham's former Borussia Dortmund teammate Elrling Haaland who was also a monster for City in their Treble season.</p>
<p>"Great teams will always vie for great players. City has managed to get the upper hand on several important occasions, like Haaland. Sometimes, it doesn't go this way, that's the way of the trade market."</p>
<h2>Bellingham as next world's best?</h2>
<p>Aguero knows a thing or two as&nbsp;, having spent most of his career as a key player for both Argentina and Manchester City.</p>
<p>He believes Bellingham can become the best English player and the best in the world's too.</p>
<p>"Bellingham is on the way to being one of the best in the world, its adaptation is truly impressive. Even as a young player, the pressure of playing for such a big team doesn't get to him. We can even see him doing great things for the national team. If he maintains this level, he can undoubtedly be named among the best."</p>
