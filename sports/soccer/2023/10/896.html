					(Photo : Ethan Miller/Getty Images) LAS VEGAS, NV - Jimmer Fredette (#7) of the Sacramento Kings talks to an official after being called for a foul against the Los Angeles Lakers during their preseason game at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on October 10, 2013 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Sacramento won 104-86. 
				<p>Jimmy Fredette probably owns one of the&nbsp;, but his skills did not translate well in the NBA.</p>
<p>What if he was born in a different era? Like the current one that puts a premium on shooters?</p>
<p>The BYU Cougars legend believes things would have been different for him. He thought he was "definitely probably a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;as far as that's concerned."</p>
<p>"Obviously, it does fit my game better now than it did before," he said during an interview with&nbsp;<em>Hoops Hype</em>.</p>

<p>"It's more positionless basketball. When I came out, it was like, is he a one, or is he a two? What's the deal? Who's he gonna guard? Now it's like if you can play, you can play, and if you can shoot, you're an asset.</p>
<p>Fredette entered the pro league in 2011 and was drafted 10th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks before being traded right away to the Sacramento Kings, where he spent three years.</p>
<p>From then on, he bounced from team to team and league to league before settling for the Chinese Basketball Association.</p>
<h2><strong>New endeavor - Olympics glory</strong></h2>
<p>At 34, Fredette has already let go of the idea of playing again in the NBA. His last stint was in 2019 with the Phoenix Suns.</p>
<p>He is now eying a bigger stage - the Olympics.</p>
<p>Fredette is currently part of the&nbsp;, and he finds it a better endeavor because he gets to spend time with his family.</p>
<p>"I have had an opportunity to go back and play 5-on-5, but at this point I did not want to because I have three kids and to go overseas and be away from them for long periods of time, it's just not something that I really am willing to do right now," he told the interviewer.</p>
