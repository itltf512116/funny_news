					(Photo : Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images) DOHA, QATAR - David Beckham, former England player looks on prior to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Group B match between England and IR Iran at Khalifa International Stadium on November 21, 2022 in Doha, Qatar.
				<p>The partnership between Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim and David Beckham might see another chapter if the former's attempt to take over Manchester United comes to fruition.</p>

<p>"I knew that once the World Cup started, not that it would go away, but it was all then about how people were treated, how people weren't excluded, what an experience the World Cup would be."</p>
