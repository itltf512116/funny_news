					(Photo : Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images) DOHA, QATAR - David Beckham, former England player looks on prior to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Group B match between England and IR Iran at Khalifa International Stadium on November 21, 2022 in Doha, Qatar.
				<p>The partnership between Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim and David Beckham might see another chapter if the former's attempt to take over Manchester United comes to fruition.</p>
<p>The two previously worked together to promote the 2022 FIFA World Cup hosted by Qatar. The English legend served as an ambassador for the event and was paid $150 million for the job.</p>

<p>"The ex-England captain is one of a number of United legends that Sheikh Jassim has earmarked for potential roles if his offer to buy the club is eventually accepted,"&nbsp;<em>TalkSport</em>&nbsp;reported.</p>

<p>"I knew there'd be questions, I knew there was going to be criticism, but I've always been a believer that football is such a powerful tool," he told&nbsp;<em>The Telegraph</em>.</p>
<p>"I knew that once the World Cup started, not that it would go away, but it was all then about how people were treated, how people weren't excluded, what an experience the World Cup would be."</p>
