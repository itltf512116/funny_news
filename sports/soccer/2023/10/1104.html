            <p>Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale&nbsp;&nbsp;his relationship with fellow goalkeeper David Raya, who has taken over as the first-choice goalie for the Premier League side in recent matches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During Arsenal's training session on Monday, October 23, as Raya stepped onto the training pitch, Ramsdale hurried to catch up with his fellow goalkeeper.</p>
<p>"It's alright lads. I'm here. We're together," Ramsdale said light-heartedly, dispelling any speculation of tension between the two as reporters looked on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ramsdale had been the primary goalkeeper for the squad over the past two seasons, during which they led the Premier League for most of the 2022-23 campaign and secured a UEFA Champions League qualification this year by finishing second.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with Arsenal's&nbsp;&nbsp;Spanish keeper David Raya on a season-long loan, the 25-year-old English international&nbsp;&nbsp;as the second-choice goalkeeper for manager Mikel Arteta's squad.</p>
<p>Despite the current situation, Ramsdale has managed to maintain a positive outlook.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Aaron Ramsdale 'suffering and hurting' for not playing</h2>
<p>Ramsdale&nbsp;&nbsp;he and Raya maintain a strong professional relationship, pushing each other during training. There are occasions when one of them might arrive feeling discouraged, and the other helps to lift their spirits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And for whatever reason, there might be a day where he's down and even though I'm suffering and hurting for not playing, I have to stand up and be able to push him," Ramsdale added.</p>
