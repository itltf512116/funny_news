					(Photo : KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Images) TOPSHOT - Chelsea's Belgian midfielder Eden Hazard celebrates after scoring a goal during the UEFA Europa League final football match between Chelsea FC and Arsenal FC at the Baku Olympic Stadium in Baku, Azerbaijian, on May 29, 2019. 
				<p>Eden Hazard, widely regarded as one of the best players of his generation,&nbsp;&nbsp;from professional football on Tuesday, October 11. However, several offers were on the table for the 32-year-old before deciding to retire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Major League Soccer (MLS) and Saudi Professional League clubs came for the Belgian attacker. Despite these approaches, Hazard ultimately decided to retire from the game.</p>
<p>The former Chelsea and Real Madrid star did not find the proposals from MLS and Saudi Arabian clubs convincing,&nbsp;&nbsp;Italian football journalist Fabrizio Romano.</p>
<p>Hazard had been considering retirement for the past four months, especially since being released a year early from his contract by Spanish giants Real Madrid.</p>
<p>"After 16 years and more than 700 matches played, I have decided to end my career as a professional footballer. I was able to realise my dream, I have played and had fun on many pitches around the world," Hazard said in his announcement post.</p>

<h2>One of the best players in Premier League history</h2>
<p>Hazard's most memorable moments come from his time at Chelsea in the Premier League, where he played from 2012 to 2019.</p>
<p>During those years, Hazard scored 106 goals in 332 matches across all competitions, helping lead the London club to two Premier League titles, two UEFA Europa League titles, one FA Cup triumph, and an EFL cup.</p>
<p>In 2019, Hazard made a high-profile move to Real Madrid, with the club paying a transfer fee of $114 million for his services. Unfortunately, his time in the Spanish capital was marked by fitness and injury issues.</p>
