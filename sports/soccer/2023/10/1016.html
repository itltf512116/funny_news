					(Photo : Richard Heathcote/Getty Images) LONDON, ENGLAND - Harry Kane of England celebrates after scoring the team's third goal during the UEFA EURO 2024 European qualifier match between England and Italy at Wembley Stadium on October 17, 2023 in London, England.
				<p>Harry Kane scored two goals in the England national football team's&nbsp;&nbsp;over their Euro 2020 Final slayers, Italy, showing that even after 11 years of prime, he is still at the top of his game.</p>
<p>The English star is now with Bayern Munich after ending his lengthy relationship with Tottenham Hotspur, but the Premier League club's fans might want to hold their breath because a Kane return might be possible.</p>
<p>That is if Kane's goal of playing until his 40s materializes.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old striker, fresh from their revenge win against Italy, shared that he&nbsp;&nbsp;even if he has been playing for over a decade.</p>

<p>His inspiration for that? Superstars and rivals Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.</p>
<p>"It all depends. You see some players who want to have a different change or challenge so I would never be able to tell you what I will do but at the moment, I just want to keep playing," he told reporters at Wembley Stadium.</p>
<p>"When you look at [Cristiano] Ronaldo and [Lionel] Messi, that makes me believe and shows it is possible to play until your late thirties and that is what I am planning to do."&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Return to Tottenham</h2>
<p>Kane, Premier League's&nbsp;, did not explicitly say that a return to North London is already being planned, but he continues to express his love for the Spurs.</p>
<p>"There is no other team in the Premier League I would want to win than Tottenham," he said while commenting on how happy he is with the recent successes of his former club.</p>
