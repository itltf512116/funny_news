<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Manchester United &nbsp;1-0 victory in their UEFA Champions League match against FC Copenhagen on Tuesday, October 24, at their home ground, Old Trafford.</p>
<p>The win would not have been possible thanks to the contributions of two players&nbsp;who have been under intense scrutiny.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Both Harry Maguire and Andre Onana have been under pressure and criticized heavily so far this season.<br><br>Maguire&#39;s goal gave Man United the lead in a must-win UCL game, and Onana&#39;s stoppage time penalty save secured the result.<br><br>You can&#39;t write a script like that ❤️ </p>&mdash; ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>Center-back Harry Maguire, who was stripped of his captaincy duties for the team over the summer, scored the only goal of the match in the 72nd-minute courtesy of a cross from midfielder Christian Eriksen.</p>
<p>The English team was clinging to their razor-thin advantage when midfielder Scott McTominay conceded a penalty for Copenhagen after the allocated four minutes of stoppage time.</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Andre Onana, who has faced significant criticism since he arrived from Inter Milan in the summer due to several mistakes between the goalposts, &nbsp;of his young United stint.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old swatted away forward Jordan Larsson's penalty to secure United's first Champions League win of the season, keeping their chances of advancing to the knockout stage alive.</p>

<h2>Harry Maguire vows to help the club</h2>
<p>The 30-year-old, who was on the verge of moving to West Ham during the transfer window, &nbsp;despite being stripped of the captain's armband, which went to midfielder Bruno Fernandes.</p>
<p>"I'm really proud and pleased of the way I've acted over the last six to 12 months and I've been given an opportunity now and I just want to help the team and get the club back to where it should be," the defender stated after the match.</p>
