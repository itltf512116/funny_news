					(Photo : Harry How/Getty Images) PHOENIX, ARIZONA - Orion Kerkering (#50) of the Philadelphia Phillies walks back to the dugout after being relieved against the Arizona Diamondbacks during the seventh inning in Game Three of the National League Championship Series at Chase Field on October 19, 2023 in Phoenix, Arizona.
				



            <p>The Arizona Diamondbacks and the Philadelphia Phillies figured in a close match, and both clubs' managers made pitching decisions that many fans thought were illogical.</p>
<p>However, Diamondbacks Torey Lovulla can be forgiven, as his team got away with a 2-1 victory. Fans chastised him&nbsp;&nbsp;during the sixth inning while the player was on a roll.</p>
<p>It was a different story for his Phillies counterpart, Rob Thomson, since the Philadelphia team lost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many blame Thomson for his decision to field rookie Orion Kerkering in the seventh inning instead of other veteran pitchers.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old only made his MLB debut in September.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Inquirer's Marcus Hayes even wrote post-game that choosing Kerkering&nbsp;&nbsp;Game 3.</p>
<h2>Thomson defends decision</h2>
<p>Lovulla agrees with D'backs fans that Pfaadt should've seen more pitching. It's a different story for Thomson.</p>
<p>The Canadian manager said Kerkering would still pitch if the team faces another crucial situation.</p>
<p>"The moment's not too big for him," Thomson insisted after the match.</p>
<p>"We knew, in that part of the lineup, there probably were going to be some left-handers pinch-hitting. He's really good on left-handers."</p>
<p>Thomson is not hung up on the Game 3 loss and is focusing instead on the next match. He confirmed that Christopher Sanchez will be the&nbsp;&nbsp;4.</p>
