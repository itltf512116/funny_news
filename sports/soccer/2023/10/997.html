					(Photo :  Stu Forster/Getty Images) GLASGOW, SCOTLAND - England manager Gareth Southgate congratulates Declan Rice after the 150th Anniversary Heritage Match between Scotland and England at Hampden Park on September 12, 2023 in Glasgow, Scotland. 
				<p>It is payback time for the England national football team in the Euro 2024 Qualifiers as they meet their 2020 slayers.</p>
<p>The Three Lions will&nbsp;meet Italy in Wembley&nbsp;after their clash in the&nbsp;&nbsp;that saw the Azzurri get away with the title in penalties.</p>
<p>That was the closest the British reached in a major event since a third-place finish in 1996.</p>

<p>Manager Gareth Southgate's squad is looking to top that 2020 finish, and he believes his team has&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"Everybody externally is always questioning," he said.</p>
<p>"But as a young coach you are questioning yourself just as much because you haven't got evidence. Now I've got 10-15 years of evidence. A lot of wins in this job, a lot of big nights in this job where you have far more confidence in what you're doing and the reality of consistent performances over a long period of time."</p>
<h2>Young players expected to impress</h2>
<p>Southgate might not be exaggerating with his assessment of his team, especially since the squad is filled with players that dominate Europe.</p>
<p>Kieran Trippier is hopeful that&nbsp;&nbsp;will carve his name on the international stage.</p>
<p>"Jude did unbelievable at Dortmund. He's taken that experience with him," the Newcastle United right-back said.</p>
<p>"You see he's playing with a freedom and the players around him are going to make his standards get even better. The most scary thing is he's only 20 year old. He can be the difference."</p>
