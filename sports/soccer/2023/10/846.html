					(Photo : Michael Regan/Getty Images) MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - Andre Onana of Manchester United looks dejected during the UEFA Champions League match between Manchester United and Galatasaray A.S at Old Trafford on October 03, 2023 in Manchester, England.
				<p>Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has encountered a challenging start at Old Trafford.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onana had allowed some stoppable shots past him in several Premier League fixtures and their previous Champions League game against Bayern Munich.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the Cameroonian's struggles, manager Erik ten Hag has continued to support his goalkeeper, and he confirmed that&nbsp;&nbsp;for their Premier League fixture against Brentford on Saturday.</p>
<p>"I think I need to talk to more players, but I need to talk with Andre of course. I will encourage him and I have to back him. He's a great goalkeeper," Ten Hag said.</p>
<p>The 53-year-old manager&nbsp;&nbsp;that Onana will bounce back in the coming games.</p>
<p>"[Onana] has capabilities to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world and he has shown that," the Man United boss added.</p>
<p>Two months ago, the 27-year-old signed with the Red Devils from Inter Milan in a deal worth approximately $60 million. This move was intended to fill the void left by the departure of club legend David De Gea.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Manchester United's struggles&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The team has suffered six defeats in their first ten matches across all competitions,&nbsp;&nbsp;being a 3-2 loss to Turkish club Galatasaray in a Champions League group stage match at their home ground on Tuesday, October 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are currently tenth in the Premier League standings.</p>
