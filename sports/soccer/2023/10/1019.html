					(Photo : PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) Brazil's forward Neymar leaves the field after an injury during the 2026 FIFA World Cup South American qualification football match between Uruguay and Brazil at the Centenario Stadium in Montevideo on October 17, 2023. 
				<p>Brazilian star Neymar was visibly in tears as he departed the field&nbsp;&nbsp;serious-looking knee injury towards the end of the first half of his national team's 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying match vs Uruguay on Tuesday night, October 17.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old stumbled while on the run in the 44th minute after a tangle with Uruguay midfielder Nicol&aacute;s De la Cruz, resulting in an awkward landing. Almost immediately, players from both teams gathered around him as he grabbed his left knee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Al-Hilal forward&nbsp;&nbsp;on a stretcher with both hands covering his face, displaying his distress. He left the stadium with the assistance of crutches, unable to put weight on his left leg.</p>
<p>Brazil eventually suffered a 2-0 defeat to Uruguay at the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, Uruguay.</p>

<h2>Brazil's Neymar Jr. injury status</h2>
<p>Neymar reportedly suffered a severe knee sprain per initial testing,&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The former FC Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain player is set to undergo further tests to determine if there is any potential ligament damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"These 24 hours will be important to see how the knee will respond, how will be the swelling. Imaging tests will define a definitive diagnosis. It's too early to say [if it's a ligament injury]," Brazil team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar said.</p>
<p>Neymar just returned from his most recent setback, a season-ending ankle injury that required surgery last March during his last season with Paris Saint-Germain.&nbsp;</p>
