					(Photo : Ryan Pierse/Getty Images) MOSCOW, RUSSIA - Russian Matryoshka dolls of Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and Lionel Messi of Argentina are seen in a souvenir souvenir shop ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup on June 8, 2018 in Moscow, Russia.

<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?-->Save for a recent loss that eliminated his team from playoff contention, Lionel Messi appears to be having a great time with Inter Miami and America.</p>
<p>Will he stay in MLS for more years? Only if he rejects another offer from the Saudi Pro League.</p>
<p>It can be remembered that the Saudi Pro League, in coordination with some government agencies, tried to lure the Argentinian superstar to the West Asian country by offering around $1.6 billion in three years.</p>
<p>Messi eventually rejected the offer to join Inter Miami in MLS, but with his current club about to take a vacation early, Saudi is preparing another offer to have him on loan.</p>

<p>"The internal evaluations are still ongoing; news is expected soon," said <em>Sky Sports</em>&nbsp;journalist Rudy Galetti.</p>

<p>If ever, Messi will join his , who is already with Al Nassr . The two battled it out in La Liga as part of Barcelona and Real Madrid, respectively.</p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or five times, while Messi received it seven times.</p>
<h2><strong>Rumors of a loan move to Barcelona persists</strong></h2>
<p>Rumors about Messi's next move just would not rest. Another issue hounding the global superstar is the probable return to Camp Nou to join Barcelona during the MLS summer.</p>
<p>Inter Miami manager Gerardo Martino was asked about Messi's rumored loan move to Barcelona, but &nbsp;what's going on in the mind of his star player.</p>
<p>"Is he going for fun? Maybe he's going to visit Barcelona," said Martino, in Spanish, during his post-game press conference over the weekend.</p>
<p>"Other than that, I don't know anything else about it."</p>
