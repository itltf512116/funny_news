<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The Los Angeles Lakers &nbsp;sign a player from the championship-winning 2021-22 Golden State Warriors team ahead of their 2023-24 season opener against the defending champions Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, October 24.</p>
<p>Shooting guard Quinndary Weatherspoon will be donning the purple-and-gold, having reached an agreement with the team despite their roster , including Austin Reaves, D'Angelo Russell, and Gabe Vincent.</p>
<p>Weatherspoon recently participated in preseason games for the Israeli club Maccabi Ra'anana, averaging 15.5 points while shooting 40 percent from the three-point line, according to&nbsp;league insider Chris B. Haynes.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Los Angeles Lakers are signing guard Quinndary Weatherspoon, his agent Daniel Hazan tells , . Weatherspoon averaged 15.5 points, shot 52 percent and 40 percent from distance in two NBA preseason games while playing for Israeli club Maccabee Ra’anana.</p>&mdash; Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>Weatherspoon played in 11 regular season games for Golden State, averaging 2.7 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 0.5 assists per game. He has not been part of an NBA roster since his release from the Warriors in October 2022.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old was initially drafted by the San Antonio Spurs in the second round of the 2019 NBA Draft with the 49th overall pick out of Mississippi State.</p>

<h2>Weatherspoon likely got the Exhibit 10 deal from Lakers</h2>
<p>Although the specific details of the contract were not revealed, it appears that Weatherspoon was able to ink an Exhibit 10 contract. These contracts &nbsp;one year and are valued at the minimum salary.</p>
<p>Exhibit 10 deals are not guaranteed and can be easily converted to G League contracts, allowing him to compete in the upcoming season with the Lakers' affiliate South Bay Lakers.</p>
