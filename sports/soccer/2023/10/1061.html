<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Brazil and Al-Hilal star Neymar Jr. &nbsp;for the rest of the season after sustaining two brutal injuries on his left knee while on international duty against Uruguay for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on Tuesday, October 17.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old suffered a complete tear of his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus on his left knee and will undergo surgery, as confirmed by&nbsp;Al-Hilal.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The medical tests ‚ÄúNEYMAR ‚Äù underwent, confirmed the Anterior Cruciate Ligament and Meniscus tear injury in his knee, he will be going through surgery and then a treatment program that will be determined later.. <br><br>Return Stronger  üíô </p>&mdash; AlHilal Saudi Club (@Alhilal_EN) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>Typically, an ACL injury's recovery period lasts seven to nine months post-surgery. However, an additional meniscus tear might extend his absence, potentially ruling him out for the entire season.</p>
<p>Neymar &nbsp;in the 44th minute of the qualifying match while making a run and getting entangled with Uruguay midfielder Nicol&aacute;s De la Cruz. He landed awkwardly and was carried off the field on a stretcher, visibly emotional and in tears.</p>
<p>"It's very sad moment, the worst of my life. It's not easy to get injured, undergo surgery, and then do it again just four months later," Neymar &nbsp;social media.</p>

<h2>Neymar just recovered from previous injury</h2>
<p>The Brazilian had only recently returned from his latest setback, a season-ending ankle injury that required surgery last March during his final season with Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
<p>Neymar &nbsp;Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal towards the end of the summer transfer window in July for a significant transfer fee of approximately $100 million, accompanied by an annual salary of $110 million.</p>
<p>Subsequently, he has participated in just five matches for the club, managing to score one goal.</p>
