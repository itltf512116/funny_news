					(Photo :  Aitor Alcalde/Getty Images) VALENCIA, SPAIN - MAY 21: Players and staff escort Vinicius Junior of Real Madrid off of the pitch after he is shown a red card during the LaLiga Santander match between Valencia CF and Real Madrid CF at Estadio Mestalla on May 21, 2023 in Valencia, Spain. 
				<p>Valencia are&nbsp;&nbsp;from Real Madrid star Vinicius Jr. for generalizing their whole fanbase as racist, an allegation the club said is far from the truth.</p>
<p>The incidence of racism took place on May 21 this year when Real Madrid visited Mestalla Stadium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The match was interrupted for a long period as Vinicius Jr. confronted fans who allegedy called him a "monkey." The referee intervened and said the match would be suspended if the taunting did not stop.</p>

<p>After the match, Vini Junior turned to social to express his dismay and anger over the incident and&nbsp;&nbsp;in the sport.</p>
<p>Valencia, for their part, already apologized. The three fans behind the racist remarks have been arrested and have appeared in court as well. At least&nbsp;&nbsp;for their involvement.</p>
<h2><strong>Los Ches want Vinicius Jr. to be factual</strong></h2>
<p>While the court proceedings over the incident are already rolling, Valencia wants Vinicius Jr. to stop for a moment and use facts when making accusations. This is after he allegedly said that the entire stadium was racist towards him.</p>
<p>The club asked the Real Madrid player to apologize and rectify his statement and that "we must be scrupulously precise and responsible in this type of manifestations."</p>
<p>"In the wake of the information published regarding the alleged statement made in court by the footballer Vin&iacute;cius J&uacute;nior claiming that the entire Mestalla Stadium had uttered racist insults at the match between Valencia and Real Madrid last season, the club wishes to express its surprise, rejection and indignation," Valencia said in a statement.</p>
<p>Last June, Vinicius also made an over-sweeping statement about Spain.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for the Spaniards who don't agree, but today in Brazil, Spain is known as a country of racists. And unfortunately, with everything that happens each week, I can't defend it. I agree. But I am strong and I will go to the end against the racists. Even if it's far from here," he said.</p>
