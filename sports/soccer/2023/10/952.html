					(Photo : OSCAR DEL POZO/AFP via Getty Images) TOPSHOT - Real Madrid's Spanish goalkeeper (#25) Kepa Arrizabalaga warms up before the Spanish Liga football match between Club Atletico de Madrid and Real Madrid CF at the Metropolitano stadium in Madrid on September 24, 2023.
				<p>Who is the best young player in the world right now?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it the Erling Haaland who just won his treble on his first try in the Premier League? Is he the best player on his team?</p>
<p>Is it Kylian Mbappe who won the World Cup and the last FIFA World Cup Golden Boot Award?</p>
<p>None of those two for Real Madrid goalkeeper Kepa. For him&nbsp;is tearing teams apart in La Liga and the Champions League.</p>

<p>"Right now, on a global level, I don't know if I see anyone above Bellingham," he told reporters.</p>
<p>Kepa also took into account the defensive prowess of his young teammate, who&nbsp;&nbsp;Borussia Dortmund.</p>
<p>"We are all seeing what he is capable of in each game. I hope it continues like this. He is a very mature boy, with clear ideas. And not only do we have to take him into account for the goals, but also for the defensive work he does and for the entire field he occupies. Bellingham will mark an era in Madrid."</p>
<h2>Kepa is not the only one in awe of Bellingham&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The Real Madrid goalkeeper might not be out of pocket with his comments. He was not the first to say that Bellingham was better than everyone else, even compared to those who already won on the big stage.</p>
<p>Former Three Lions turned pundit Paul Scholes also believes the 20-year-old English midfielder is "."</p>
<p>"Nothing fazes him, he looks like such a driven, determined lad and such a professional player with the temperament you need to succeed at the top level," he said in&nbsp;<em>TNT Sports</em>.</p>
