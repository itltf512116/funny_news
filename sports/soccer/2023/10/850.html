<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Former football player David Beckham humorously confronted&nbsp;his wife, Victoria, for asserting that her family is a "working class," all while pointing out that they enjoyed a particular luxury typically associated with the affluent.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hahahaha David Beckham wasn’t having Victoria as coming from a working class family. </p>&mdash; AFC GLEN (@AFC_GLEN) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>During a scene in the first episode of their new Netflix docuseries <em>BECKHAM</em>, the Spice Girls member was elaborating on what initially attracted her to David, saying that they both hail from families and parents that have worked tirelessly and have a solid working-class background.</p>
<p>The Inter Miami co-owner &nbsp;that her family was "very working class."</p>
<p>David playfully peeked from across the room and firmly urged Victoria to "be honest," catching his wife off-guard after he asked what type of car her father drove her to school back in the day.</p>
<p>Initially, Victoria hesitated, stating that it wasn't a simple answer. However, with David's insistence, she eventually revealed the answer.</p>
<p>"OK, in the '80s my dad had a Rolls Royce," the 49-year-old known as "Posh Spice" finally admitted.</p>

<h2>Beckhams open up about challenging time</h2>
<p>The famous couple &nbsp;in their marriage in 2004. During this time, rumors swirled about an alleged affair involving David while playing for Real Madrid while the rest of his family remained in England.</p>
<p>Victoria resented the media circus and the distance between her and David. Ultimately, they managed to navigate through this difficult period.</p>
