					<img title="Lamine Yamal - FBL-EUR-C1-PORTO-BARCELONA" src="/upload/images/2023/10/6/5601eab155bbcb52.jpg" alt="Lamine Yamal - FBL-EUR-C1-PORTO-BARCELONA" />
					(Photo : MIGUEL RIOPA/AFP via Getty Images) Barcelona's Spanish forward (#27) Lamine Yamal vies with FC Porto's Brazilian midfielder (#13) Wenderson Galeno during the UEFA Champions League 1st round day 2 group H football match between FC Porto and FC Barcelona at the Dragao stadium in Porto on October 4, 2023. 
				<p>FC Barcelona&nbsp;&nbsp;during their second UEFA Champions League group stage match of the season against FC Porto on Wednesday, October 4, at the Est&aacute;dio do Drag&atilde;o in Portugal courtesy of a goal by forward Ferran Torres just before the first half ended.</p>
<p>The evening was not without a comedy relief when, during the 71st minute, teenage sensation Lamine Yamal had to leave the game abruptly for an unscheduled toilet break, leaving Barca to play with only ten men on the pitch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the 16-year-old had to be subbed by Marcos Alonso when he failed to make it back in the 80th minute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barcelona manager Xavi explained the reason for the bizarre event.</p>
<p>"Lamine was unwell. He had an illness, he had been telling me for a while. I took advantage of a break to tell him to be quick and go to the toilet, but in the end they told me that he wouldn't be able to get back on the pitch," the tactician said.</p>

<h2>Lamine Yamal makes UEFA Champions League history</h2>
<p>Still, the Spanish wonderkid&nbsp;&nbsp;by being the youngest-ever to start a Champions League match at 16 years and 83 days of age, surpassing the previous record set by Celestine Babayaro at 16 years and 86 days, achieved with Anderlecht in November 1994.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in the season, Yamal also became the youngest-ever debutant for Barcelona and the second-youngest player in Champions League history when he played against Royal Antwerp two weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>
