					(Photo : CHRIS ARJOON/AFP via Getty Images) Inter Miami's Argentine midfielder (#11) Facundo Farias (R) fights for the ball against Toronto's Spanish midfielder (#52) Alonso Coello during their Major League Soccer (MLS) football match at DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on September 20, 2023.
				<p>Inter Miami attacking midfielder Facundo Farias&nbsp;&nbsp;about his path to joining the MLS club, a journey that required a significant sacrifice by his wife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having previously played for the Argentine side Atletico Colon, the 21-year-old disclosed that his wife, Angi, was surprised upon discovering that they would need to relocate to Miami after Farias&nbsp;&nbsp;with the MLS club at the end of July.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move required Farias&nbsp;&nbsp;so that he could pursue his opportunity to play alongside Argentine icon Lionel Messi in the United States, a decision she understandably found difficult to accept.</p>
<p>"She was studying her major but we had to move here. She wanted to kill me! But I told her, 'We're going to play with Messi!," the Argentine shared.</p>
<p>Since making his debut for the pink club, Farias&nbsp;has scored&nbsp;three goals and dished out 2 assists in 12 appearances across the MLS and the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup.</p>

<h2>Facundo Farias on cusp of milestone</h2>
<p>Farias' decision to move has proven to be rewarding,&nbsp;&nbsp;to the Argentine national football team for their forthcoming pair of 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches this week.</p>
<p>Farias is set to debut for the reigning FIFA World Cup champions on Thursday, October 12, as they face Paraguay. Another match awaits him on Tuesday, October 17, against Peru.&nbsp;</p>
