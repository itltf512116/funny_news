					(Photo : Octavio Passos/Getty Images) PORTO, PORTUGAL - Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal during the UEFA EURO 2024 European qualifier match between Portugal and Slovakia at Estadio do Dragao on October 13, 2023 in Porto, Portugal.
				<p>Football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has won almost everything a footballer needs to win in his career, so it would be understandable if he decides to hang his boots anytime soon.</p>
<p>He is&nbsp;&nbsp;and is building a family. Those are enough motivations to settle down.</p>
<p>Well, CR7's love for the beautiful game is so great that retiring is not something he is planning yet.</p>
<p>"Things have happened in my life, both on a personal and professional level, that make me think more in the short term nowadays. People say I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp;or 41 years old. I don't set these targets," he said.</p>

<p>"It's a question of just enjoying the moment, which is a good moment. I feel good. My body is responding to how I've treated it over the years. I'm happy both at my club and in the Selecao. I've scored plenty of goals, I feel in good shape physically."</p>
<p>Cristiano has two more years before turning 40, but his body appears younger than his age with how he plays in the Saudi Pro League.</p>
<p>He is currently leading the Saudi Arabian top league with 10 goals in eight games, even&nbsp;&nbsp;games for his team, Al Nassr.</p>
<h2>Last World Cup?</h2>
<p>CR7 almost won everything - almost because one trophy that is not yet on his CV is the FIFA World Cup.</p>
<p>The most prestigious competition remains a target for the Portuguese star, as reports from Portugal revealed that Cristiano wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;to stay eligible for a national team call-up.</p>
