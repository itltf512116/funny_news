<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?-->The topic was the Travis Kelce-Taylor Swift romance, but it looked like Shams Charania and Kay Adams have their own budding romance. At least based on how fans and viewers interpreted their flirtatious moment.</p>
<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shams Charania&#39;s face when Kay Adams grabbed his phone on live TV is a must-see 😅<br><br>(via )</p>&mdash; ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) </blockquote>

</center>
<p>The pair discussed the NFL in "Up and Adams" and how Swift's romance with Kelce seems like a PR stunt.</p>
<p>The NBA insider said he loves love but referred to Adams as the NFL insider as if suggesting she knows more than everybody.</p>
<p>"I love love. I'm a fan of love," Charania said before attempting to brush the question off, adding: "But you're the NFL insider."</p>

<p>That was a vague answer from Charania, so Adams took matters into her own hands.</p>
<p>"You wanna know how I'll find out?" before grabbing his cell phone and threatening to reveal what's inside.</p>
<p>"This is a crime that's been committed," Charania responded.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be a simple, playful moment between colleagues, but some fans caught on and thought they were openly flirting.</p>
<h2>Are Shams and Kay single?</h2>
<p>Charania, 29, is reportedly single and has had one documented girlfriend in the past. He is known as someone who is laser-focused in his job as an NBA insider and competitor of Adrian Wojnarowski.</p>
<p>Fans were even astounded when he revealed his &nbsp;is 19 hours.</p>
<p>How about Kay Adams?</p>
<p>Adams is a well-known NFL scooper; like Shams, she is single. There is , although she has been linked to a few NFL players before.</p>
