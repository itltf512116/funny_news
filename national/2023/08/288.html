   <p>Two former leaders of the Proud Boys, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl, were sentenced to 17 years and<strong> </strong>15 years<strong> </strong>respectively in prison for seditious conspiracy and other crimes committed during the riot more than two years ago. </p>   <p>Biggs is a former military service member who helped lead efforts by the Proud Boys to take over the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Rehl, also a former military service member, was a leader of the Philadelphia chapter of the Proud Boys. </p>   <p>Judge Timothy J. Kelly also sentenced Biggs to three years of supervised release and a ban on any interactions with organizations that advocate violence against the government. </p>    for his actions during Jan. 6.</p>   <p>Back in May, Biggs and Rehl  former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio and other fellow Proud Boys member Ethan Nordean. A fourth defendant, Dominic Pezzola, was acquitted of seditious conspiracy but found guilty of assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers and robbery involving government property. </p>   <p>Prosecutors wanted to apply a "terrorism enhancement," which leads to longer prison terms.</p>   <p>Judge Kelly chose to apply that enhancement to one of Biggs' and Rehl's charges regarding their role in the destruction of a fence surrounding the U.S. Capitol building which, once gone, no longer kept the mob back from law enforcement protecting the building. </p>   <p>But Kelly said he believed Biggs and Rehl had no intention of killing anyone and had no motivation to incite mass casualties. </p>

   <h3 class="edTag">Biggs says he was 'seduced' by mob on Jan. 6</h3>   <p>Before being sentenced, Biggs begged for forgiveness and leniency. He downplayed his role in the Jan. 6 riots and said that day was set to be the last event he planned to do with the Proud Boys as he had plans to step back from the organization.</p>   <p>"I was seduced by the crowd," Biggs said of the mob in front of the U.S. Capitol. "Curiosity got the better of me and I will regret that for the rest of my life."</p>   <p>Biggs cried as he begged Kelly to allow him an opportunity to be present for his young daughter who he said was molested by a family member and is now in the care of his mother.</p>   <p>"I am not a terrorist," he said. "I know I have to be punished, but at least give me the opportunity to take my daughter to school one day."</p>   <h3 class="edTag"><strong>Rehl in an emotional speech says he is 'done peddling lies'</strong></h3>

   <p>During his trial, Rehl painted himself as a family man. He has repeatedly denied assaulting officers, even as he was confronted with video of him spraying law enforcement officers with chemicals. </p>   <aside id="ad-third-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>When he addressed the court, Rehl was emotional throughout his speech. </p>   <p>Rehl said he lost military benefits and professional licenses he's worked for. </p>   <p>And he promised he was done with politics. </p>   <p>"I'm done with all of it," he said. "I'm done with peddling lies for other people that don't care about me."</p>   <p>He continued, "I'm sorry for everything that happened. January 6 was a despicable day. I did things I regret. I made my family suffer because of it."</p>
