   <p><strong>What's the big deal?</strong></p>   <ul class="edTag">   <li>We're about to enter the fifth month since the Writers Guild of America went on strike May 2. Since then, all of the late night shows have gone on hiatus and the staff has been out of work. According to the first episode of the  podcast, all the proceeds from the show will go to support their staff during the strike.</li>   <li>Members of SAG-AFTRA, the actor's guild, have also been on strike since July. Under the strike agreement, union members aren't allowed to promote Hollywood productions they're a part of – the bread and butter of many late night shows.</li>   <li>In the premiere episode, the hosts explain that when the strike was imminent, the five of them spoke regularly over Zoom to figure out ways to support their staff. This show was the result.</li>   </ul>

   <hr>   <strong>.</strong></p>   <hr>   <p><strong>What are people saying?</strong></p>   <ul class="edTag">   <li>"I instantly thought it was a great idea," said Bill Carter, author of two books on late night television,  and .&nbsp;"Those guys are sidelined, along with everybody else. And they also get along pretty well, which is kind of atypical for the history of late night."&nbsp;</li>   <li>Back in the 2007-08 writers' strike, David Letterman owned his own company, which allowed him  and come back on air. The other shows, with the guild's blessing, came back before the strike ended and produced shows without their writers to help support the rest of the show staff.</li>   <li>Carter notes that he is a dues-paying member of the Writers Guild of America. Some NPR staff are also members of SAG-AFTRA, but operate under a different contract.</li>   <li>The first episode of is performing well on the charts. As of this writing, it's currently sitting at the top of and is number two.&nbsp;</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>So, what now? </strong></p>   <ul class="edTag">   <li>The show is slated for 12 episodes. </li>   <li>If the premiere is any indication, we can safely assume there'll be more bits, banter and war stories from the hosts' time in the Hollywood trenches.&nbsp;</li>   </ul>   </li>   <li></li>   <li></li>   </ul>
