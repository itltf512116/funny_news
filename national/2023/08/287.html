   <p>"Nobody died, that's the key," Tallahassee resident Doug Everett, one of the owners of Ware Oil and Supply Co., told </p>   <p>"Most everybody here, company-wise, evacuated. As a matter of fact, my county manager was just rolling back into town from evacuation. They don't know what their house looks like, they haven't been there yet," he added. </p>   <p>All along the Big Bend region, survivors are emerging to take stock of their losses. </p>   <p>"I don't ever want to go through that again," one Florida resident, Ron Elrod,"When you see the walls on the building that you're in move, it makes you wonder whether you made the right decision to evacuate. But I'm glad we left."</p>   <p>Elrod and his family of four, plus two cats and a dog named Buddy, waited out the storm from inside a friend's garage in Perry, after leaving behind their trailer in the hard-hit town of Steinhatchee. The family and the trailer were still intact on Thursday. </p>   <p>"A lot of our people in Steinhatchee weren't as lucky as us. Some told me they saw houses floated out of the river mouth," he said.</p>   <p>In South Carolina, the National Weather Service "major coastal inundation," including in downtown Charleston where water had broken through the historic seawall, the Charleston battery.</p>    at the request of Florida Gov.

   <p>More than 210,000 homes and businesses were , according to the monitoring site PowerOutage.us, and broken traffic signals throughout the region are adding another layer of danger to travel conditions.</p>   <p>DeSantis said more than 420,000 customers have had their power restored since the storm hit. Unlike in past hurricanes, the bulk of these outages are in very rural counties where the power distribution comes from small electric co-ops rather than large utilities.</p>   <p>DeSantis said that tens of thousands of linemen were at work trying to restore power in his state alone. </p>   <p>Unlike past disasters, there may be one or two homes along a five or 10 mile stretch of road – so it could take days or longer to re-string lines across these large distances to connect a handful of customers. It's unclear if power substations were heavily damaged – which would take longer to rebuild.</p>   <p>Kevin Guthrie, the director of Florida's Division of Emergency Management, says the vast majority of customers should have power restored in 48 hours.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">What's happening with search and rescue efforts?</h3>

   <p>Despite the damage, only a handful of deaths have been linked to the hurricane, a sizable contrast to , which claimed 149 lives when it pounded Florida last year. </p>   <p>At least one person was killed in Georgia when a tree fell on a vehicle, , said in a briefing Thursday. </p>   <p>Meanwhile, Florida Highway Patrol officials said two men were killed in separate rain-related crashes hours before Idalia struck the state.</p>   <p>Gov. DeSantis said Florida officials were vetting "one unconfirmed fatality" as a possible storm-related death, but he didn't say whether it was one of the two Florida deaths reported earlier in the day. </p>    </p>
