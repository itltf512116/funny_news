   <p>Ady Barkan, the progressive attorney and activist who grew to prominence campaigning for health care reform after being diagnosed with ALS, has died of complications of the disease. He was 39. </p>   <p>His death was announced on Wednesday by , his partner of 18 years, as well as , the political organization he co-founded in 2018.</p>   
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi all, this is Ady’s wife, Rachael. I’m devastated to share the news that Ady has died from complications of ALS. You probably knew Ady as a healthcare activist. But more importantly he was a wonderful dad and my life partner for 18 years. [1/4] </p>&mdash; Ady Barkan (@AdyBarkan) </blockquote>

   <p>Barkan was a lifelong social justice advocate who championed a variety of causes, from expanding worker rights to reforming the Federal Reserve. After he was diagnosed with the terminal neurological disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) in 2016 — just months after the birth of his first child — he turned his focus towards improving Americans' access to health care. </p>   <p>"The knowledge that I was dying was terrible, but dealing with my insurance company was even worse," Barkan said  for a 2021 documentary about his life and activism. "I wanted to spend every moment I had left with Rachael and Carl, but then Congress came after our health care. I couldn't stay quiet any longer." </p>

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote in the accompanying blurb that "Ady and the movement he has behind him bring us closer than we have ever been to making health care in America a basic human right."  </p>   <p>Barkan  that he learned early on that his ALS compelled people to listen to him with "newfound attentiveness." </p>   <p>"The paradox of my situation has been that as ALS has made my voice weaker, more people have heard my message," he said.
