   <p>Charlottesville prevailed in a protracted legal battle with the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other groups, and donated the Lee statue to a coalition that proposed to melt it down and create a more inclusive public art installation.</p>   <p>"We want to transform something that has been toxic in the Charlottesville community," says , a religious studies professor at the University of Virginia and one the project's organizers. "We want to transform it into a piece of art that the community can be can be proud of, and gather around and not feel excluded or intimidated." </p>   <p>"People are willing to die for symbols," Schmidt says. "And as we saw in Charlottesville, they're willing to kill for them too." </p>   <p>Lawsuits to stop the project failed, and last weekend organizers moved forward, with great secrecy, to disassemble and melt down the Lee monument.</p>   <p>The work is being done at an out-of-state foundry. NPR agreed not to reveal its location or the identity of the workers because they fear repercussions. </p>

   <p>A furnace is ignited and heats to more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit in a side yard of the foundry. Workers feed pieces of the verdigris statue, including General Lee's saber, into a large vessel inside called a crucible. </p>   <p>"We are turning swords into something else," says Douglas. "That saber is the object of violence and it was the object of power, the object of conquest. I think that is an important symbol to really sort of dig into" </p>   <p>Just after nightfall, foundry workers remove the crucible which glows a bright red-orange, and pour the steaming molten bronze into molds.</p>

She sees opportunity in this moment. </p>   <p>"I'm most excited about what it looks like to repair — what reparations look like for folks in Charlottesville, what it looks like to tell this new story," Henderson says. "I think this is a joyful occasion in a really dire strait of political nastiness that we've been surviving." </p>   <p>For the Rev. Isaac Collins, a Methodist minister, the deadly white nationalist violence in Charlottesville in 2017 was a turning point for the nation, and personally.</p>

   <p>"As a Christian, as a white person in this country, it was a moment that made me reconsider everything about how I understood our country, how I understood my family, how I understood myself and my identity." </p>   <p>Collins, who pastored a church in Charlottesville at the time, says it is surreal to see the focal point of that episode disassembled.</p>   <p>"I was thinking Humpty Dumpty couldn't be put back together again," says Collins. "We still have a lot of work to do, but this statue that has cost us so much, so much violence, so much hurt, so much bloodshed – it's gone. And it's never going to be put back together the way it was." </p>

                The project to transform the former statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee is called Swords into Plowshares, taken from a Bible verse in the book of Isaiah.
