   <p>LEWISTON, Maine — The suspected perpetrator of this week's mass shooting in Maine has been found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities announced Friday.</p>   <p>Robert Card, 40, was the sole suspect in the fatal attack at a Lewiston bowling alley and bar on Wednesday that left .</p>   <p>The announcement late Friday night capped a two-day manhunt that forced residents to shelter in place and businesses and government offices to temporarily close as state and federal law enforcement agencies scoured several towns for the alleged killer. </p>            
                        <h3 class="slug"></h3>

   <p>"Like many people, I'm breathing a sigh of relief tonight knowing that Robert Card is no longer a threat to anyone," Maine Gov. Janet Mills said at a late-night press conference. "I know there are some people — many people — who share that sentiment, but I also know that his death may not bring solace to many. But now is a time to heal."</p>   <p>Mills thanked first responders and said she informed President Biden and other federal elected officials that the suspect had been found dead.</p>   
            
                  
                        <h3 class="slug"></h3>

   <p>"Lewiston is a special place. This isn't us," Mills added. "It's a close-knit community of fine people, people with a long history, a history of hard work, of persistence, of faith, of opening its big heart to people everywhere."</p>   <p>Mike Sauschuck, commissioner for the state's Department of Public Safety, said Card's body was located in Lisbon Falls near the Androscoggin River.</p>

   <p>President Biden  following news of Card's death, calling it a "tragic two days" for Lewiston and the entire country.</p>   <p>"Numerous brave law enforcement officers have worked around the clock to find this suspect and prevent the loss of more innocent life – all while risking their own. They are the best of us," Biden said.</p>   . </p>   <p>Earlier Friday, investigators continued to search Schemengees Bar and Grille and Just-in-Time Recreation to recover all available evidence.</p>   <p>As part of that effort, law enforcement officers were drafting affidavits for digital media, including phones and computers. Sauschuck had said police were investigating 3,500-plus tips and leads from around the community, noting that their credibility "varies greatly."</p>

Chellie Pingree, who represents Maine's First District — which is next to Lewiston — in Congress,  early Friday that the search for Card was "all-out," involving more than 300 law enforcement officers from across the country.</p>

They called the police and transported him to a hospital for evaluation, though it's not clear what, if any, treatment he received. </p>   <p>Authorities earlier Friday declined to say whether law enforcement had been notified of warnings about Card's behavior that would have triggered . They also declined to say whether Card's family was cooperating with the investigation.</p>
