   <p></p>   <p>A manhunt is underway for a man who is considered a "person of interest" following two mass shootings in Lewiston, Maine, that left "multiple casualites," officials said Wednesday night.</p>   <p>Maine Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck said during a Wednesday night news conference that 40-year-old Robert Card of Bowdoin, Maine, should be considered armed and dangerous, and that his car had been found in the nearby town of Lisbon.</p>   <p>Sauschuck said there have been multiple casualties, but declined to give a number of those killed and injured, saying the numbers "are all over the map." Sauschuck said the shootings began at 6:56 p.m. ET.</p>   , the Lewiston Police Department released what appeared to be a driver's license picture of Card. He appears to be the same person shown in surveillance images wearing a brown sweatshirt and carrying an AR-style long gun as he entered a bowling alley in an earlier photo release by authorities. </p>   <p>The department said members of the public should contact law enforcement if they have more information about his whereabouts. </p>
