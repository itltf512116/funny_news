   <p>Voting is now  in the  competition, celebrating the ability of brown bears to pack on weight for their hibernation cycle in Alaska. To do that, they must gobble tons of fish — and luckily, they live near a thriving sockeye salmon run.</p>   <p>"Essentially those fat stores have to keep them healthy from late October till June," when the salmon return to the Brooks River, media ranger Naomi Boak of , told NPR.</p>

   <p>"We have some of the largest bears on the planet," Boak said. "The big boars, the biggest guys, can get to be between 1,000 and 1,400 pounds."</p>   <p>But it's not just about the guys.

   <p>The contest — and yes, we are aware the contestants are refreshingly oblivious, being bears — might seem simple. Just pick the most rotund bear, right?</p>   <p>But many voters often give extra credit to any bear that dramatically went from a gaunt, emaciated creature in the spring to a portly ruler of the river in October. And some bears just gain fans with their quirks and personal stories.</p>

   <p>Fans of 128 Grazer, known for her big blonde ears, are hoping this is her year. She's a recent empty-nester: having successfully raised two sets of cubs, she's been able to focus on herself.</p>   <p>"She has been putting in the work," ranger Felicia Jimenez said as the . "She was quite dainty in early summer, but now she is huge."</p>   <p>Grazer also has a penchant for preemptively attacking huge males to protect her offspring, so many of her male rivals gave her a wide berth this summer — including 151 Walker, her first opponent in the bracket.</p>   </h3>

   <p>"Once bears enter hyperphagia in late summer, Leptin, the chemical that tells the body it's full, is suppressed," according to the . "This allows bears to eat until it's time to sleep."</p>   <p>In people, hyperphagia is treated as a disorder — "the extreme unsatisfied drive to consume food," as  puts it. In bears, the condition is a survival tactic, as they prepare to go without food for months.</p>
