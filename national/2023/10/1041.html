   <p>Many of the attendees were grappling with mourning the lives lost and the ongoing violence. </p>   <p>"It's hard because it just feels like it's not gonna stop for a while and after a while I just kind of go numb," said Matthew Gever.</p>   <p>Miguel Tablo, who has family in Israel, said his initial reaction after hearing that Hamas militants were attacking Israel was one of "profound sadness for the events and anger because we find ourselves again here after all this time with needless loss of life for absolutely no reason."</p>

   <p>Among the attendees was Hunter Benson, who is converting to Judaism. She's visited the synagogue multiple times prior to the vigil and expressed her desire to show support for her community. </p>   <p>"I feel that I am compelled to support the community right now. Always, but specifically ,– with what's going on in Israel and just for the loss of humanity that's happening over there right now," Benson said.</p>   <p>While other members of the community came to comfort one another. </p>   <p>"I'm seeing terrible reports of just barbaric acts and, needed to be around the community tonight for, for some support," said Samantha Goldstein. </p>
