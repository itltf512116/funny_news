   <p>For more than two weeks now, Tariq Luthun has been unable to sleep. </p>   <p>"I barely have time to engage in the act of living," he says. From his home in Detroit he's watching his family's home of Gaza be flattened, block by block. </p>   <p>Inundated with images of bombs and rubble and broken bodies, he is at turns devastated and terrified. Sometimes he just feels numb. </p>   <p>The bombing began as a response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which left more than 1,400 Israelis dead. Israel says were taken over the border.  </p>   <p>Since then, Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 5,000, according to Palestinian officials. About 100 more have been killed in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The United Nations has said that over  people in Gaza have been internally displaced. </p>

   <p>According to human rights groups, Gaza is in the depths of a humanitarian crisis, a direct result of Israel's bombing and "" of the enclave. Over the weekend, the first trucks carrying  started to trickle through from Egypt to Gaza, part of a U.N.-brokered deal helped along by leaders of various countries, the U.S. among them. President Biden has continued to say his administration  while that country to minimize civilian casualties.</p>   <p>To be Palestinian American in this context, Luthan says, is to feel erased – like the deaths of your people don't matter.</p>   <p> The dozen Palestinian Americans NPR talked to from around the U.S. say they are mourning Gaza, while feeling completely abandoned by their country. On top of that, they fear rising anti-Palestinian sentiment and Islamophobia. </p>   <p><strong>"We're not even allowed to grieve" </strong></p>   <p>Luthun does data engineering by day. By night he's a poet and a community organizer. He mostly has done work around disability justice, but ever since the war started, he's been on Zoom calls and group texts with other organizers, strategizing the best way to call for a ceasefire and stop the bombing. He says around 75 percent of his family is in Gaza. So far, they've survived.</p>

   <p>"I'm literally watching my family get bombed and then being gaslit to say, 'Oh, they deserve it,'" Luthun says. He hears Hamas being conflated with innocent Palestinians like his family, or that all Palestinians bear responsibility for Hamas' attack on Israel.</p>    of Gaza's population are children, meaning many weren't alive, let alone old enough to vote back then.</p>   <p>For two weeks Israel's "complete siege" of Gaza has halted food, medical supplies and fuel from getting in. Power and water are still cut off. Saturday, after waiting at Egypt's Rafah crossing,  of aid were allowed into Gaza; Sunday, a United Nations  that another dozen or so trucks were allowed in. But the United Nations  it's only a drop in the bucket for a besieged population of more than 2 million, as Israel's bombing campaign . More than  are still waiting to cross. Palestinian civilians are still trapped inside Gaza, with no way out.</p>

   <p>Hani Almadhoun works at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the primary relief organization in Gaza, so he knows how things work on the ground. He lives in the D.C. area, but was visiting with his family, just a few weeks ago. </p>   <p>But now, "even if I wanted to go to Gaza, I can't. If I want to get my family out of Gaza, I can't," he says.</p>   <p>Almadhoun says some of his family went south, after Israel  1 million Palestinians to leave Gaza City. Other members stayed together on the edge of northern Gaza – because Israel also bombed . </p>   <p>He says most of his family members are huddled together in an apartment building, staying away from windows during the day, sleeping under staircases at night, aware they could die at any moment. </p>   <p>When Almadhoun finally got in touch with his mother a week into the bombing, she asked to do a video call so she could see his face, in case it's the last time. </p>

All of her siblings are gone, and they can't find her father in the rubble. </p>   <p>He says it's not just the stories of loss and horror he's hearing from Gaza – it's also what he feels is a callous response to those horrors by people here in the U.S.</p>   <p>When NPR first talked with Almadhoun, he had just seen a video on social media, shared by a friend and colleague in Gaza. It showed the body bags of at least 20 of his friend's family members, all dead.</p>   <p>"'Oh, this is fake,'" he says people wrote in the comments on his friend's post. "'These are not real people. These are Hamas fighters.'"</p>   <p>"We're not even allowed to grieve," he says.</p>   <p><strong>"No understanding" </strong></p>   <p>Empathy isn't the only thing absent from the discourse, says Rania Mustafa, executive director of the Palestinian Community Center, an advocacy group in New Jersey. Many conversations that are happening here in the U.S. are missing key context, she says, as if everyone is picking up a book in the middle, thinking it's the beginning.</p>   <p>She says American politicians, media and culture are stuck in what she calls a false narrative that this latest siege began with Hamas' attack – when decades of complicated history preceded this moment.</p>
