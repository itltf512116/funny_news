The U.S. has invested nearly $3 billion into its launchers, interceptors and general maintenance, according to a .</p>

   <p>And there is likely more U.S. aid in the pipeline, with  that the federal government is "surging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome."</p>   <p>In addition to Biden's pledge, a group of U.S. lawmakers in the House  this week that would appropriate an additional $2 billion to help bolster the Iron Dome.</p>   <p>Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., said the move would be "critical to increasing American security assistance for Israel's missile defense system, which is saving millions of innocent lives."</p>   <h3 class="edTag">Is it used elsewhere, like Ukraine?</h3>   <p>Thanks in part to the investment and collaboration with Israel on the Iron Dome, the U.S. has two Iron Dome batteries.</p>   <p>The Ukrainian government has made a number of requests for Israeli-made defense systems — including the Iron Dome — since Russia invaded in February 2022.</p>

   <p>Yet in June of this year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  that Israel would not be sharing technology or insight on its missile defense system with Ukraine, citing concerns that "if that system were to fall in the hands of Iran, then millions of Israelis would be left defenseless and imperiled."</p>   <p>But Karako says Israel's exclusive use of this technology could change.</p>   <p>"There are other countries in Europe and elsewhere in the world that are certainly looking at this ... for its relatively lower cost, for its sooner availability and for its proven record."</p>
