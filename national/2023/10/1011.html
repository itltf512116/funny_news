   <p>It's fall, which means it's Scholastic Book Fair season. Schools across the country are setting up shelves in their libraries and gymnasiums to let students shop a vast selection of books provided by the educational and publishing company. It's a highlight for many students, and a nostalgic memory for many adults. </p>   <p>But the events have also waded into controversy, after the company behind them changed its policy to help schools navigate the growing number of book bans in the U.S. — and was quickly accused of caving to censorship.</p>   <p>The accusations started swirling  and  last month: Scholastic — the billion-dollar educational company that both publishes and distributes books — was allowing schools to opt out of providing diverse books at its nationwide book fairs, according to complaints by several school librarians.</p>    on Friday, but defended its decision. Enacted or pending legislation in more than 30 states prohibits certain kinds of books — mostly "LGBTQIA+ titles and books that engage with the presence of racism in our country" — from being in schools, the company said.</p>

   <p>Because book fairs take place in schools and without parental supervision, it said, such laws create "an almost impossible dilemma: back away from these titles or risk making teachers, librarians, and volunteers vulnerable to being fired, sued, or prosecuted."</p>   <h3 class="edTag">Scholastic says it's trying to help schools navigate a complicated landscape</h3>   <p>The company said in order to continue offering diverse books, it created a new collection for its elementary school fairs called "Share Every Story, Celebrate Every Voice."</p>   <p>"We don't pretend this solution is perfect — but the other option would be to not offer these books at all — which is not something we'd consider," Scholastic said, adding that there are still diverse titles at all of its book fairs and that middle school fairs remain unchanged.</p>

   <p>A Scholastic spokesperson told NPR that the company has been in touch with customers about the new policy since August.</p>   <p>They said many school districts had questions and concerns about how to navigate the new legislation, which in some cases took effect over the summer. Those conversations, they added, weren't about how to eliminate certain books from their fairs, but how to safely hold a fair in the current climate.  </p>   <p>According to a list shared with NPR, out of the more than 100 titles in this year's book fair, most of the books dealing with issues of race, gender and sexuality are in the "Share Every Story, Celebrate Every Voice" collection.</p>

   <p>The case includes some 30 books, ranging from  to biographies of Rep. John Lewis, Ruby Bridges and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. There are picture books and graphic novels by poet Amanda Gorman, civil rights activist and football player , and Jojo Siwa, a dancer and internet personality who  in 2021. A book based on the PBS animated show  features a Puerto Rican family hunting for a kid's missing tooth.</p>   , which said it found 3,362 cases of book bans in the 2022-'23 school year, up from 2,532 bans in the 2021-'22 school year. The group defines a ban as any move that restricts access to a book. A majority of book restrictions, according to an NPR/Ipsos poll.</p>   <p>It says such bans in schools and libraries are most prevalent in Texas, Florida, Missouri, Utah and South Carolina, but are being "modeled and replicated across the country."  </p>   <p>Many districts are still figuring out what new book bans mean for their classrooms and libraries.</p>   <p>The wording of the laws themselves — and the resulting legal back and forth — have created a lot of confusion,  where one of those new laws temporarily takes effect this month after an appeals court blocked a judge's injunction against it.</p>
