   <p>In the late 1960s, natural gas utilities launched "," a bold marketing campaign to bring lots more gas stoves into people's kitchens.</p>   <p>The gas utilities called Operation Attack their "most ambitious advertising and merchandising program ever." But as it got underway, concerns were becoming public about indoor pollution from gas stoves, including household levels of nitrogen dioxide.</p>   <p>Around the same time, Dr. Carl Shy, a federal public health researcher, was looking into the health effects of nitrogen dioxide. In 1970, Shy  showing that families exposed to greater levels of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide outdoors had higher rates of respiratory illness than families in less-polluted areas. The research caught the attention of the gas utility industry, and they asked Shy for a meeting.</p>

   <p>When they met, Shy heard from the gas industry something Americans are now learning about, more than 50 years later: the potential health risks from cooking with gas stoves. "They are the ones who told me that the gas stoves produce nitrogen dioxide because of their high temperature," says Shy, now 91, at his home near Durham, N.C. "They said the hoods above gas stoves were really not powerful enough to pull out the nitrogen dioxide."</p>   <p>But in the following decades, the gas industry argued the opposite, asserting that range hoods could clear up this pollution. And it has contended that fumes from cooking food are more of a problem than the fossil fuel pollution of nitrogen dioxide.</p>   <p>The narrative was part of a lengthy campaign by the gas utility industry to popularize gas stoves. Yet as it advertised the appliance, the industry also financed its own research into the potential harms from cooking with gas. Those industry-backed reports confused consumers and muddied the science that regulators relied on about the potential dangers of cooking with gas, according to an investigation by NPR and documents , a research and watchdog group.</p>   .</p>   <p>The documents show that natural gas utilities and their powerful trade group, the American Gas Association (AGA), focused on convincing consumers and regulators that cooking with gas is as risk-free as cooking with electricity. As the scientific evidence grew over time about the health effects from gas stoves, the industry used a playbook echoing the one that tobacco companies employed for decades to fend off regulation. The gas utility industry relied on some of the same strategies, researchers and public relations firms.</p>   <p>The documents show that AGA and utility companies funded studies that countered the emerging research on health risks, sometimes without disclosing their financial support. The industry-backed studies focused on uncertainties in the health research and magnified them, leaving the impression that the science is not clear, even as evidence has accumulated about a link between using gas stoves at home and greater risk of respiratory illnesses.</p>   <p>Research backed by the gas industry generated doubt and controversy over the health effects of stoves that affected policymaking around protecting people's health. It helped stop efforts to more stringently regulate gas stoves in at least one instance under the Reagan administration. And documents show the research may have helped thwart efforts to strengthen federal nitrogen dioxide pollution standards outdoors, which affects millions of Americans.</p>   <p>Those successful tactics are still relevant today, as state and federal regulators once again examine the health risks that come from cooking with gas, and as natural gas use becomes a flashpoint in the effort to reduce planet-heating emissions.</p>   <p>"I think it's way past the time that we were doing something about gas stoves," says Dr. Bernard Goldstein, professor emeritus at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health. He , nitrogen dioxide and indoor air quality in the 1970s. "It has taken almost 50 years since the discovery of negative effects on children of nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves to begin preventive action. We should not wait any longer," Goldstein says.</p>

   <p>Presented with findings from NPR and CIC's reporting, AGA Chief Executive Karen Harbert did not directly deny them. "The natural gas industry has collaborated with subject matter experts and research to develop analysis and scientific studies to inform and educate regulators about the safety of gas cooking appliances," Harbert wrote in an email to NPR. "The available body of scientific research, including high-quality research and consensus health reviews conducted independently of industry, does not provide sufficient or consistent evidence demonstrating chronic health hazards from natural gas ranges," Harbert writes.</p>   <p>The gas stove plays an outsized role in the gas utility business. It doesn't use much natural gas, but house builders and real estate agents say many buyers demand a gas stove.

That's why some in the industry consider the stove a "gateway appliance."</p>    "cooking with gas" campaign. In the late 1960s, gas utilities sought to reverse a  toward electric ranges. "For the first time in the gas industry's long history, in 1968 the shipment of gas ranges to market fell below 50% of the total range shipments," W. Morton Jacobs, then president of AGA, warned colleagues a year later in the association's magazine.</p>   <p>That prompted the AGA to launch "." The goal of the $1.3 million campaign (about $11 million, adjusted for inflation) was to boost gas range sales 15% in the first year.</p>   <p>As Operation Attack was getting underway, concerns about pollution from gas cooking stoves were growing among scientists and regulators.</p>   <p>A few years earlier, in 1962, at the National Conference on Air Pollution, Dr. Theron Randolph  that the gas stove was among the indoor sources of air pollution making his patients ill.

            Gas utilities have promoted "cooking with gas" for nearly a century, while also funding research over the last five decades that cast doubt over health risks. The gas stove plays an outsized role in the gas utility business. It doesn’t use much natural gas, but house builders and real estate agents say many buyers demand a gas stove.

In 1972, at an AGA conference at Disney World in Florida, Darrow explained that he had long consulted for the industry and  Randolph's claims that "gas appliances are major indoor polluters."

At right: A nitrogen dioxide air monitor shows 0.159 parts per million, or 159 parts per billion. That's above the World Health Organization hourly guideline of 106 ppb. Kephart has since replaced the gas stove with an electric one.

   <p>Samet says he never did research for the tobacco industry and that it set "a high water mark for egregious behavior and discrediting science." He does not see that same behavior when it comes to the gas industry and health effects of cooking with gas.</p>   <p>"Over my career, there are people who felt that I waited too long before perhaps saying that X causes Y. But that's because I don't think we want to have false positive determinations," Samet told NPR. Scientists say accomplishing that in epidemiology can be tricky because often there are multiple factors present that could be causing a health problem.</p>   <p>When it comes to assessing science that will inform new policies, Samet says it's rare that one study is enough to reach a conclusion. "I've been involved in enough of the development of authoritative reports in different contexts to take the view that the right way to understand what the science shows is to put it all together," Samet says. "And sometimes, unfortunately, the answer is that we don't have enough. So if that's conservative, that's fine."</p>    about the health effects of nitrogen dioxide pollution includes five gas stove studies that showed "no significant difference" or "no evidence" of problems. Four of the five were funded by the gas industry, though that went undisclosed in a scientific journal. The Climate Investigations Center tracked down industry funding for the research through references in the AGA's monthly magazine and through a report published by the Gas Research Institute.</p>

The article ends with "it can be concluded that the gas range's emissions are not a source of respiratory illness in the indoor environment."</p>   <p>In 1986, the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) was investigating potential health effects from gas stoves and asked the EPA for advice on the state of science regarding the issue.  by the EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee says, "Human epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure may lead to increased respiratory illness rates among children." But the report also included undisclosed, industry-funded studies that highlight uncertainty in the science.</p>   <p>Those mixed messages in the report found a receptive audience at the Reagan administration's CPSC, where appointees were proud to call themselves "deregulators," according to then-Chair Terrence Scanlon. He told NPR he didn't remember the gas stove inquiry but was always a "hesitant regulator." NPR found no evidence the issue was pursued further at the commission.</p>   <p>Since then, independent scientists have continued to produce studies that provided more detail and evidence about how gas stoves affect human health.</p>   <p>A  by Duke University and EPA researchers found that children in a home with a gas stove have about a 20% increased risk of developing respiratory illness. A  showed 12.7% of childhood asthma cases in the U.S. can be attributed to gas stove use in homes.</p>   <p>The weight of evidence is starting to shift again, away from the gas utility industry's interests. Now, it's pushing back with some of the same tactics that worked to forestall regulation in the past.</p>

                A 1992 analysis by Duke University and EPA researchers found that children in a home with a gas stove have about a 20% increased risk of developing respiratory illness. A 2022 analysis showed 12.7% of childhood asthma cases in the U.S. can be attributed to gas stove use in homes.

   <h3 class="edTag">Tobacco-style tactics are still in use</h3>   <p>In 2022,<strong> </strong>the health department in Oregon's Multnomah County reviewed the scientific evidence and  against using gas stoves. County commissioners held a public comment hearing, and toxicologist Julie Goodman from the firm Gradient was the first to speak. Gradient is an environmental health consultancy that largely works for industry clients, and it has a  of casting doubt over science on behalf of clients facing stricter regulation or lawsuits.</p>   . A utility spokesman told NPR there was no effort to hide her connection to NW Natural and that she was asked to speak because of her .</p>   <p>In an email to NPR, Goodman says that while her "preparation time and time spent at the hearing was funded by NW Natural," the views were her own. She disagrees that scientists are biased in favor of their funding source. "All scientific work has a funding source. This does not mean that all scientific work is biased or beholden to predetermined conclusions," she writes. Goodman says she strives "for independence and scientific integrity in all my work" and that disagreement among scientists "is a critical step in the process of advancing science."</p>   <p>But firms like Gradient do not have a good reputation among public health researchers.</p>   <p>"In my field, we know who those groups are, and we know that work that's done by those groups is not really trustworthy because they have never taken a stance on the side of public health," says Laura Vandenberg, professor of environmental health sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst. She co-authored a  that lists the tactics industries and groups use to manufacture doubt about "knowable facts."</p>    that calls gas stoves "a Public Health Concern," and the  warned of an "association between the use of gas stoves, indoor nitrogen dioxide levels and asthma."</p>   <p>Within the last year, the AGA continued funding research that focuses on and amplifies uncertainties. Gradient  in April, funded by AGA, that surveys available research and concludes it "does not provide sufficient evidence regarding causal relationships between gas cooking or indoor NO2 and asthma or wheeze."</p>   <p>Two days later, AGA President and CEO Karen Harbert  as an effort "to ensure regulators and policymakers can confidently make decisions based on sound data developed using reliable methods as they approach any issues related to natural gas."</p>   <p>The gas utility industry is ramping up rhetoric and openly talks about fighting to save its business. In 2021, Harbert  that her industry wants to be part of solving the climate problem and has developed a  on the issue. "If the goal is to reduce emissions, we're all in," she told NPR. "If the goal is to put us out of business, not so much."</p>   

    
        
    
        
            <p>America's romance with gas stoves has been fueled by a decades-old "cooking with gas" campaign from utilities that includes vintage , , and even this cringeworthy 1980s rap video.</p>

   <h3 class="edTag">An existential question for gas utilities</h3>   <p>Gas utilities face another kind of pressure beyond health concerns, and it raises questions about the future viability of their business: the significant contributions natural gas makes to climate change.</p>   <p>Under the Biden administration, the U.S. has set a goal of reaching net-zero emissions across the economy by 2050. Net zero means that any planet-warming pollution is balanced out by efforts to reduce or remove it, like using more renewable energy, for example.</p>   <p>The AGA has developed a  for gas utilities. But a growing list of studies, including those from ,  and the , find that meeting the net-zero goal will require electrifying buildings, making appliances more efficient, and powering them mostly with emission-free sources like renewable energy.</p>   <p>A  from the consulting firm Brattle Group paints a dire picture of the financial future of many gas utilities. As governments push to convert to electricity in buildings to meet climate goals, the firm warns of a "death spiral" as customers migrate toward "electrification."</p>   <p>Local governments are leading the way toward electrification. Berkeley, Calif., was the first in the nation to ban new gas hookups in homes and is  in federal court. The California Energy Commission (CEC) approved  that require extra ventilation for gas stoves over electric ones. New York state is  and furnaces in most new buildings.</p>   <p>With the gas stove being a "gateway appliance" for utilities, preserving its place in Americans' lives is a priority for the industry. The  to eliminate energy efficiency standards that would reduce the variety of gas stoves currently on the market. And the industry's angst about the future was on display at an  for contractors last March at Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. NPR obtained a recording of the presentations.</p>   <p>"We like to say it's an all-of-government approach and they are coming after natural gas," Sue Forrester, AGA's vice president of advocacy and outreach, told industry colleagues. "So they're coming in to tell you what kind of stove you can have in your house, what size burners you can have and what you can use it for."</p>   <p>While the gas industry claims it is being targeted by the Biden administration, others have criticized the president for not doing more to , and instead  and . The climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that Biden signed last year includes incentives to help the oil and gas industry reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.</p>   <p>But the natural gas industry is the target of environmentalists who are pushing to reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels. And advocates focused on kicking gas out of buildings to meet climate goals see opportunity in the health issues surrounding gas stoves. Colorado-based RMI's  prominently features a report on gas stoves. And the group is among those pushing the CPSC to regulate gas stoves.</p>   <p>Earlier this year, with the body of science once again pointing to a problem, the CPSC launched an  into hazards associated with gas stoves and proposed solutions.</p>   <p>"I think we need to be talking about regulating gas stoves, whether that's drastically improving emissions or banning gas stoves entirely," Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr. said in a December . A week later, 20 Democratic members of Congress  to the CPSC encouraging the commissioners to take action.</p>   <p>Conservatives have latched onto the issue and pulled gas stoves into the . Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., "Democrats are coming for your kitchen appliances," and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, "COME AND TAKE IT."</p>   <p>Trumka and CPSC Chair Alex Hoehn-Saric tried to tamp down the controversy by saying there was no plan to ban gas stoves. While the CPSC inquiry continues, so far no plans to begin drafting regulations have been announced. Meanwhile, 11 attorneys general  on the commission to develop ventilation and emission standards for gas stoves.</p>   <p>Shy, now retired from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says recent studies have reassured him that the  were correct — that cooking with a gas stove does come with potential health consequences. That's why he's always chosen to have an electric stove in his home.</p>   <p>"I recently did have a choice. I had to replace my 40-year-old electric stove, and I replaced it with another electric stove. I wouldn't even have considered a gas stove," Shy says. At 91 years old, Shy says he doesn't have any preexisting conditions like asthma, but "I just didn't want to pose a risk in our home to exposure to a harmful air pollutant."</p>
