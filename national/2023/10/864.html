   <p>As high school seniors at KIPP DC College Preparatory in Washington, D.C. took their seats in AP U.S. Government class this week, they were already talking about the day's lesson: what had just happened in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>   <p>"Well, it happened last night," said teacher Christopher Gleditsch. He was talking about what he had prepared students for in class a day earlier: the ouster of Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) as Speaker of the House.</p>   <p>He hit play on a video clip showing the vote and its momentous result.</p>   <p>"And with that gavel, history was made. This has never happened before in American history," Gleditsch told the class.</p>

   <p>"But like ... isn't that how Congress is supposed to work? Aren't you supposed to work together?" Gleditsch countered.</p>   <p>"I feel like that's how it's supposed to be," a student named Jakiya suggested. "But how Congress is set up now, it's like Republicans and Democrats will always have that separation going on because there's certain situations that they cannot agree on and they don't agree on. Like when we learned about Republican philosophies and Democrat philosophies, they see things in two different ways."</p>   <p>Halfway across the country, polarization was also top of mind in Joe Kennealy's class at Hiawatha Collegiate High School in Minneapolis. His students sat in a circle, with the day's  newspaper strewn out in the center with the top headline "McCarthy Dumped in GOP Revolt."</p>

   <p>These conversations about government aren't really a priority in a lot of schools across the country. That's according to Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.</p>   <p>"One of the things about civic education that's challenging is that we neglected it for the past three decades or so for sure," she says.</p>   <p>A 2021 funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the U.S. Department of Education estimated that the federal government spends about $50 per student per year on studies related to science and math, but only five cents on civics.</p>   <p>That's a problem, Kawashima-Ginsberg says, because not only does civics education teach students how the government is supposed to function, it also teaches students how to disagree with one another in a productive way.</p>   <p>"Schools can offer different opportunities in that students will meet somebody that thinks differently than themselves. And that practice of doing that with somebody and then still coming back with something they learned is going to go a long way," says Kawashima-Ginsberg, who was on the report committee.</p>

                The turmoil on Capitol Hill provided fodder for high school civics classes, including one at KIPP DC College Prep in Northeast Washington, D.C.

   <p>Back in the Minneapolis classroom, one student, Zakariya, was feeling less than enthused about the turmoil in the halls of Congress. But, he said, he's not sure whether lawmakers care what he thinks.</p>   <p>"If I had an opinion, like, it wouldn't really matter to them," Zakariya says. "They're all like closed door meetings, like all the rules that they make."</p>   <p>Kennealy, his teacher, was across the room listening. </p>   <p>"I'd like to think that that's not where [Zakariya]'s going to end his journey," Kennealy says. "But I do think civics and government class, if it's done right, does help students to understand more of those systems that are in place that they're already in."</p>   <p>The classes give them tools to make sense of what's happening on Capitol Hill – and to recognize whether Congress is functioning like it should.</p>
