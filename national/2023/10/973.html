   <p>PORTSMOUTH, N.H. — Former President Donald Trump made a rare visit to New Hampshire this week. </p>   <p>He hasn't been to the crucial primary state very often – only a handful of times - and generally avoids the retail politics that put candidates through the political wringer.</p>   <p>But other Republicans, like Nikki Haley, have notched dozens of visits - and it shows as she jumps to second in the polls – though still far behind Trump.</p>   <p>"It doesn't feel like a typical New Hampshire primary," said Craig Jewett, who owns a commercial construction company. "It does feel a little different."</p>

   <p>Those days are dwindling. And it's raising uncomfortable questions about the upcoming election.</p>   <p>In small state primaries, like New Hampshire's, voters get to go out and kick the tires, per se, before everyone else.</p>   <p>That system is now under threat, said Ryan Williams, who worked for Mitt Romney on his 2012 presidential campaign. </p>

   <p>At his rally in nearby Wolfeboro, Trump touted his large lead over the Republican field.  And he suggested he didn't need to come.  </p>   <p>"In fact, somebody said, you don't have to come to New Hampshire, sir. You're leading by 44 points. You don't have to come. I said, 'no way.' "</p>   <p>New Hampshire is seen by many Republican strategists as, perhaps, the last best chance to disrupt the trajectory of the primaries.  </p>   <p>The Granite State is considered to have a more diverse group of Republican voters than Iowa, for example. But the state also has an open primary that will allow independents and Democrats to cast ballots.</p>   <p>"New Hampshire is a reminder that we don't do this nomination process nationally, that the undeclared voters, the Republican voters in New Hampshire have a chance to say, we're going to take a look at all these other candidates," said Jon McHenry, a national GOP pollster from New Hampshire. </p>   <p>"So we're going to sort of put them through their paces and see which one we really want to be the standard bearer for our party rather than just Donald Trump holding a few rallies and rolling to a nomination again," McHenry added. </p>   <p>The walls of the Roundabout Diner document the array of candidates who have sat at the countertop to share a meal with potential voters over the years. They include Trump, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. </p>   <p>Those eating breakfast at the diner are very protective of that tradition.</p>

   <p>At a booth near the kitchen, Wendy McGillis, a former Navy cryptographer, warns candidates against taking the state for granted. </p>   <aside id="ad-third-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">
    

    

</aside>
   <p>She brings up how Hillary Clinton never visited Wisconsin in her 2016 campaign and ended up losing the state.</p>   <p>"She didn't go out there and put her face out there, McGillis said. "She just assumed, erroneously, that she was going to win. You can't do that. You can't assume."</p>   <p>Her daughter, Kristen Richard, also prefers the traditional way of meeting candidates face-to-face. </p>   <p>But the 40-year-old program manager said it's not realistic to expect Trump to follow those same traditions when he's already been president - and is already a household name.</p>   <p>"He is around," she said. "He is doing interviews. Just on his own terms."</p>   <p>As she scoops her whipped cream with a bite of French toast, Harrington says Trump has left a door open for his rivals, who have been doing the retail politics of a traditional primary campaign.</p>   <p>"That's why Nikki [Haley] is making some nice gains, because she is doing that," Harrington said. "She's taking the time to come."</p>   <p>Jewett adds: "She's kind of won us over." </p>   <p>But he's been at this long while and says, there's still time for someone else to come to New Hampshire and change their minds.</p>
