                Lots of factors influence what we eat, everything from taste preferences, to budgets and culture. New research suggests genetics may also play a role.

   <p>People are motivated to try a vegetarian diet for different reasons – from ethical and religious, to potential health and environmental benefits.  But many people have a hard time sticking with it.  In fact self-reported vegetarians actually do consume some animal products. </p>   <p> "A lot of people who want to be vegetarian are perhaps not able to," says , of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. "We wanted to know if genetics is part of the reason," he says.</p>   <p>Yaseen and his collaborators compared the DNA of about 330,000 people, using data from the initiative. The study included 5,324 vegetarians, who had not eaten any animal flesh or products derived from animal flesh for at least one year. </p>   n , a peer-reviewed science journal.</p>   <p>Deciphering the genetic role is not exactly an easy riddle to solve. Humans have  and there are  in DNA building blocks, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms  where you can see differences between individuals.</p>

   <p>To identify SNPs that are statistically associated with the particular trait of adhering to a vegetarian diet, Yaseen and his colleagues did a .</p>   <p>"You're looking for markers in the genome, basically trying to see if a certain trait tracks with a certain region of the genome," explains Yaseen. When they found a SNP associated with vegetarianism, they looked to see the genes around it in the same area.  </p>   <p>Of the three genes most strongly associated with vegetarianism, the authors say two of them (known as NPC1 and RMC1) have important functions in lipid – or  fat – metabolism. The study can't answer exactly how genetic differences could shape or influence vegetarians, but Dr. Yaseen has some ideas. </p>

   <p>The idea  that some people might find it easier to follow a vegetarian diet due to genetic predisposition is interesting, says , a food scientist at Stanford University. And he points out that people don't need to go completely vegetarian to see benefits. </p>   <p>He points to research that shows impacts on  would be significant, even if people just decreased the amount of meat they eat each week. </p>   <p>"There is clearly an important benefit – and probably more realistic benefit – of reducing meat without cutting it out completely," Gardner says.</p>   <p></p>
