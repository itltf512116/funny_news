   <p>Comic Roy Wood Jr. says he will not return to his position as a correspondent on Comedy Central's  when the show resumes new episodes later this month, ending a job he first started eight years ago.</p>   <p>The reason: Since he hasn't been offered the job as permanent host of the show, Wood wants some time to figure out his next act.</p>   <p>"I can't come up with Plan B is while still working with Plan A," says Wood, who has decided he doesn't want to be on as a correspondent waiting for someone else to take the top job.  "The job of correspondent...it's not really one where you can juggle multiple things. [And] I think eight years is a good run."</p>

   <p>"If you're offered the chance to host  at any point in your life...you have to stop for a second and consider that," he says, adding that he has not informed  of his decision. "The next question becomes, 'What does look like in 2024? And what does late night look like in 2024?'" <br/><br/>Fans have debated online whether Wood should get the permanent job, particularly following  that former correspondent Hasan Minhaj was a leading candidate to land the position.</p>

   <p>Wood seemed to make a strong case for taking over the top job earlier this year, after a successful week guest hosting  in early April and an attention-getting set at the  at the end of that month. </p>   <p>"How Roy Wood Jr. crushed the toughest room in comedy,"  in the ; notables ranging from  to departed  host Noah all said Wood should be a strong contender to lead the program permanently. <strong> </strong>According to figures provided by Comedy Central in April, Wood had the second-best ratings of the show's first 11 guest hosts, second only to Al Franken and beating Minhaj.</p>

   <p>Still,   that Minhaj, who guest hosted the show the week of Feb. 27, was a leading candidate for the job, according to several unnamed sources. Other comics who had guest hosted the show, like Chelsea Handler and Sarah Silverman, were also rumored to be in contention.</p>   <p>But  that Comedy Central "is going back to square one" in its search for a permanent host after   revealing Minhaj had fabricated and exaggerated autobiographical stories in his standup specials, including incidents involving islamophobia.</p>

   <p>Wood says the story about Minhaj — which Comedy Central has not publicly confirmed — made him think more about his future on the show. And he still thinks Minhaj is a strong candidate for the job, despite the story.</p>   <p>"I think Hasan checks a lot of boxes that the network would want and people would want," Wood adds. "Hasan's young, he's global and he has the political I.Q." </p>   <p>'s process of finding a permanent host has likely been extended by the Writers Guild of America strike, which led the show to stop production of new episodes in May just as correspondent Dulce Sloan began her stint as a guest host. The show announced it will return to new episodes on Oct. 16 with a new lineup of guest hosts, with plans to install a permanent host in early 2024.<br/><br/>Wood, 44, joined as a correspondent in 2015; one of the first performers hired by Noah as he arrived to succeed Jon Stewart as host. Raised in Birmingham, Ala., he's starred in three standup comedy specials on Comedy Central, also appearing in TV shows and films like and .</p>   <aside id="ad-third-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>He stresses that he doesn't hold a grudge against Comedy Central, which he credits for working with him on several non- projects, including the standup specials, two podcasts, a filmed pilot for a TV series that never aired and three scripts they bought but never produced.</p>   <p>But late night TV has seen a recent exodus of non-white stars — from Desus and Mero and Ziwe to Trevor Noah himself. And Wood remains concerned that, as the genre contracts, people of color are stuck in a "last hired, first fired" position.</p>   <p>"I don't believe diversity to be the paramount priority [anymore]," Wood says. </p>
