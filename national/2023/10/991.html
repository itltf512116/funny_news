   <p><strong>What are Imam Herbert and Rabbi Brous saying?</strong></p>   <p>The rabbi and imam spoke with  host Ari Shapiro on Friday. They talked about the messages they're sharing with their congregations, and spoke to one another directly with messages of peace.</p>   <p><strong>On how they're guiding their congregations:</strong></p>   <blockquote class="edTag">   <p><strong>Imam Herbert: </strong>For our sermon [on Friday], what we've prepared is kind of a reflection piece, taking an opportunity to reflect on our lives internally and then to think about how it is that we will respond externally, right? Faith without action is absolutely useless, and action without faith is misguided. And so when we speak about an internal response to how it is that we internalize everything that's happened, one of the key things that I hope for my community to step away from the sermon with is understanding that there is pain on both sides, right? </p>   <p><strong>Rabbi Brous:</strong> I see the pastor's task as offering some kind of moral clarity, which in this case means both repeating again and again that there is no justification for crimes against humanity ... And I also need to remind my community that Palestinians are suffering terribly also now and will continue to in the days ahead. And so just as we ask the world to see our pain and stand with us in our sorrow, it's our moral and spiritual obligation to do the same, to expand our lens of care and concern to also encompass the Palestinian people. </p>   </blockquote>   </li>   <li></li>   <li></li>   </ul>   <p class="contributors-text"></p>
