                States and counties nationwide are using opioid settlement funds for law enforcement efforts, including buying new squad cars. This draws criticism that the funds should be invested in treatment instead.

   <p>Paving roads or building schools is out of the question. But if a new cruiser helps officers reach the scene of an overdose, does that count?</p>   <p>Answers  in real time.</p>   <p>The money shouldn't be spent on "things that have never really made a difference," like arresting low-level drug dealers or throwing people in jail when they need treatment, says , who served as a police officer for 23 years and is currently an assistant professor at Brown University researching policing and public health. </p>   <p>At the same time, he adds, "you can't just cut the police out of it. Nor would you want to."</p>   <p>Many communities are finding it difficult to thread that needle. With fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, flooding the streets and  dying of overdoses each year, some people argue that efforts to crack down on drug trafficking warrant law enforcement spending. Others say their war on drugs failed and it's time to emphasize treatment and social services. </p>

And last year, staffers saved a man who was overdosing on opioids he'd smuggled in. In both cases, officers hadn't found the drugs, but the scanner might have identified them, Bishop says.</p>   <p>"The ultimate goal is to save lives," he adds.</p>   <p>St. Clair County also approved the purchase of a scanner with settlement dollars.
