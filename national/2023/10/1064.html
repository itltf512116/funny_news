   <p>On the island of Guadeloupe, officials had urged residents to be aware of shelter locations, while nearby Dominica closed schools on Friday. </p>   <p>Hurricanes so late in October are rare for the Atlantic basin, experts say, particularly so far to the southeast. Scientists warned earlier this month that an unusually warm Atlantic Ocean — linked to the El Niño weather pattern — could precipitate the formation of storms in less common locations.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">Tropical Storm Norma makes landfall in Mexico</h3>   <p>Tropical Storm Norma made landfall Saturday afternoon as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80 mph near the popular Mexican tourist town of Cabo San Lucas, later weakening to 70 mph winds in the evening.</p>   <p>Tropical storm warnings  in Mexico early Sunday from Santa Fe to San Evaristo and from Huatabampito to Mazatlan.</p>   <p>The center of the storm was hovering over the Gulf of California Sunday morning, between Mexico's Baja California Sur and Sinaloa states.</p>   <p>Those areas were expected to experience tropical storm conditions, including high winds, coastal and urban flooding and as much as 18 inches of rain. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are also predicted in coastal areas.</p>   <aside id="ad-secondary-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>The storm system is expected to move east to the mainland of Mexico Sunday night or early Monday.</p>   <p>Though Norma currently has maximum sustained winds around 60 mph, forecasters expect "rapid weakening" once the storm moves over mainland Mexico.</p>
