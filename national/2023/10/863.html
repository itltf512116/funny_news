   <p>With in the House of Representatives that removed Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his post atop the chamber, one particular Republican rose to national attention for his role as Congressional disruptor: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida</p>   <p>After leading the group of hardline Republicans who fought against funding the government and blasted McCarthy for the deal he did to avert a government shutdown, Gaetz delivered a Motion to Vacate, the procedural resolution that can remove a speaker from that position. </p>   <p>But even after the vote and amid searing critique from his fellow Republicans, Gaetz remained defiant. </p>

   <p>Matt Gaetz has been making political waves in Florida for a long time. The son of Florida's former Senate President, he was first elected to Florida's legislature 13 years ago at 31. Then, in 2016, he ran for - and won - a congressional seat.</p>   <p>Even before that though, he was cementing himself as a self-described 'firebrand,' also the title of his 2020 autobiography. </p>   <p>The chair of Florida's Democratic Party, Nikki Fried, remembers a young, high-school student already stirring things up. As a college student, she helped run a debate tournament that Gaetz appeared in.</p>   <p>"And he was actually kicked out of our student Congress for being disrespectful, disruptive, getting his way or the highway," she recalled. "So unfortunately, these are the patterns of who Matt Gaetz is."</p>   <p>After​ publication, a spokesperson for Gaetz disputed Fried's account, saying she is wrong and Gaetz has never competed in a student Congress event, nor has he been kicked out of a competition. </p>   </p>&mdash; Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) </blockquote>

   <p>Gaetz also led an attempted breach on the secure facility where impeachment proceedings took place against former president Donald Trump during his first impeachment. </p>   <p>That changed at the beginning of the 118th Congress when Gaetz stood in opposition to Kevin McCarthy in his initial bid for the speakership. Ultimately,  before receiving enough votes to become speaker. Gaetz did not vote for him once. </p>   <p>An ally and supporter of Trump's, Gaetz firmly aligned himself with the former president during his time in office and has remained by his side since. </p>

   <p>Still, back home, Gaetz's constituents who cheered on his actions aren't sure it will actually pay off for him - or for them. </p>   <p>"It might be a risk for him. I'm glad he did it. In my view, the more Congress doesn't do anything, the better off Americans are," Patty Burke said. She's been local in GOP politics for more than 20 years and has followed Gaetz's career. </p>   <p>But, she's worried the Republican Party might now be seen as a party in disarray. Another Republican at the Santa Rosa County meeting, George Oedsma is less worried about his own party and more worried about the control Democrats still have in Washington. </p>   <p>"Republicans over many, many years, we're always told we have to compromise. But whenever we do, we get nothing and they get everything they want," Oedsma said. "It just seems like that over and over and over again."</p>   <p>As for whether Gaetz's actions will pay off? </p>   <p>"Ask me in a year from now and I might be able to tell you," he said.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">So, what now?<strong> </strong></h3>   <p>Gaetz did not take McCarthy down with the intent of taking the job. He has made it clear that he has no interest in being speaker. It is unlikely he would have the votes to take the job as the polarizing figure in his party that he has become. </p>

   <p>The House will need to choose its new leader before it can do any additional legislative business. But even with the 45-day continuing resolution to give Congress more time to fund the government, a potential shutdown is again, just around the corner. </p>   <p>Gaetz is unlikely to waver from his position on a conservative approach to funding the government. The first congressional district in Florida has more federal employees than any other district in the state and is home to a number of military installations, accounting for even more federal spending. </p>   , "I know who I work for, and it's not the people in Washington D.C." </p>   <p>"It is the Americans who elected me to change Congress for the better," Gaetz said. </p>
