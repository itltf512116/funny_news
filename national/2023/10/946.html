   <p><strong>What's the big deal? </strong>After a seven year hiatus, Clowes is back for the newest installment of his work, which was released last week.</p>   <ul class="edTag">   <li>is the summation of stories depicting the life and experiences of the eponymous protagonist, from being abandoned by her mother as a child to her mysterious connection to the afterlife.</li>   <li>Clowes, whose own mother left him with his grandparents when he was 5, says that although he doesn't share life experiences with Monica, he feels that the process of writing her life was the result of trying to "create somebody who sort of shared the same emotional experience I had growing up."</li>   </ul>

   <hr>   <strong>.</strong></p>   <hr>   <p><strong>What's he saying? </strong>Clowes spoke with  host Juana Summers to discuss the attachment and processing he experienced through creating this work.</p>   <p><strong>On how much of the book is autobiographical:<br/></strong></p>   <blockquote class="edTag">   <p>There's not a single fact, I think, that lines up with my life. But the beats of her life, sort of the rhythm of her childhood and adulthood line up, you know, sort of algebraically exact with those of my life. In this story, Monica's mother runs a candle shop, and that's sort of her dream. And my mother ran an auto repair shop. That was her dream.</p>   </blockquote>   <p><strong>On his own relationship with Monica:<br/></strong></p>   <blockquote class="edTag">   <p>You know, I've created a lot of characters over the years, and some of them seem like they only exist in the pages of the book. But Monica feels — despite the ending of the book, which I won't reveal — she feels like she still exists out there somewhere, you know, and I might one day actually meet her. That happens sometimes, where characters just feel like they're out there living their own lives. And you'll meet readers who act that way. They act as though the characters are independent of my creation. They're just talking about them like they're people, and that's always very gratifying.</p>   </blockquote>
