   <p>Eboo Patel, the founder and president of Interfaith America — an organization that works with nearly 1,000 campuses on interfaith issues — described a phone call he got from a college president who was worried that a peaceful vigil could turn violent.</p>   <p>His response was that colleges need to be two things right now: communities of care and cooperation. People are hurting, he adds, and words matter.</p>   <p>"We're not going to minimize the conflict, we're simply going to say that we are not going to allow the conflict to prevent us from cooperating on other things," Patel says. "That's the genius of American college campuses. That's what college presidents and athletic directors and faculty and staff and students need to keep their focus on right now."</p>   <h3 class="edTag">The conflict gives new urgency to a long-divisive topic</h3>

   <p>Jewish students say they're scared, too, with antisemitism on the rise in much of the country. A  found that 57% percent of Jewish college students report having witnessed or experienced an antisemitic incident, either on their campus or in the general public.</p>   <p>Caroline Yaffa, a senior at UNC-Chapel Hill, says she feels unsafe because of several recent incidents on campus. She says her parents are worried about her safety going to classes, and the thought of showing her ID — with her Jewish last name — at a bar makes her anxious now.</p>   <p>"It's so upsetting because I love my heritage, I love my religion, I love going to synagogue, I love celebrating the holidays with my family when we all get together, and I'm not ashamed of it," she said. "But I also want to protect my safety."</p>   <h3 class="edTag">Students want to feel heard and supported</h3>

   <p>Yaffa believes universities are obligated to weigh in on events like the Israel-Hamas conflict because they represent "every single person in their community" and should protect all of its members. She said she would have felt safer on campus if UNC leadership had done more beyond talking with students and posting a statement on social media.</p>   <p>Hours after she spoke with NPR on Friday, UNC Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz  condemning Hamas' actions in Israel and promoting resources for all affected students and staff, for which Yaffa said she was "beyond grateful."</p>   ) has chapters at hundreds of U.S. campuses and has been behind many of the . The organization's steering committee — a mix of both current students and recent graduates — told NPR over email that they don't believe universities always need to take a public stance on global events.</p>   <p>But they say universities do have an obligation to defend students' rights to speak and protest, and protect them from smear campaigns and doxxing. They said public university statements have maligned pro-Palestinian protests as support for violence, "even while vocally affirming their right to free speech."</p>   <p>"Universities have intentionally abandoned Palestinian, Arab, and anti-Zionist students in this political moment, giving tacit support to the dangerous backlash they face," they added.</p>   <p>Sainath, the Palestine Legal attorney, says she has seen a pattern of schools putting out statements that only mention the pain and loss of Israeli and Jewish students, "basically erasing Palestinian pain."</p>   <p>Students from all backgrounds and viewpoints are hurting, and the first priority of any college should be to respond to that human suffering, says Patel, of Interfaith America.</p>   <p>"That is not both sides-ism," he says. "That is: There is a human being in front of me whose family is in danger and that person is hurting and I am going to show that person care."</p>   <h3 class="edTag">What if colleges stopped weighing in altogether?</h3>

   <p>Alex Morey, the director of campus rights advocacy at civil liberties nonprofit , said universities are under pressure — and competing demands — to weigh in on current events.</p>   <p>She says institutions were in a similar position in 2020, with the confluence of racial justice protests, a raging pandemic and a high-stakes presidential election. Since then, it's been common for schools to release statements about all sorts of issues.</p>

   <p>Morey would like more of them to say: "We are a university that plays host to these debates of issues that are of incredible importance. We are not going to put our thumb on the scale as the university one way or another because that will chill the environment for free expression, for scholarly inquiry."</p>   <p>She says those institutions will get pushback in the immediate term, but will make their lives much easier in the medium- and long-term.</p>   <p>She says there are other ways university leaders can support students when difficult things are going on in the world, like offering condolences and counseling services.</p>   <p>"The best thing they can do when these divisive issues come up is do their university thing," she adds. "That's what they do best: Host these debates, have students come together in a way that is constructive and in a way that students feel like they have a place to be heard and that the debate can go on in a scholarly, civil way."</p>
