   <p>For years, the U.S. Army has not been able to meet its annual recruitment goal. The Secretary of the Army, Christine Wormuth, is rolling out a plan to address that.</p>   <p><strong>What is it? </strong>Well, a little bit of something old, and a little bit of something new.</p>   <ul class="edTag">   <li> The Army is bringing back its iconic ad with the slogan, "Be all you can be," which was everywhere in the '80s, hoping to inspire new recruits and perhaps touch on that nostalgia nerve too.</li>   </ul>   <ul class="edTag">   <li>But more broadly, the Pentagon is seeking to widen the net for recruits; focusing less on traditional pools and seeking to expand to new groups.</li>   </ul>    — or 25%.</li>   <li>For young people, especially Gen Z, increasing is also likely playing a part; and some younger Americans that NPR spoke to about joining the Army said they were afraid of getting hurt or killed if they were to serve.</li>   <li>Other concerns voiced by students include reports of and within the armed forces.</li>   </ul>

   <p><strong>What are people saying? </strong>The Secretary of the Army, Christine Wormuth, spoke to about the specifics with this recruiting strategy, and how they hope to adapt.</p>   <p><strong>On bringing in college students and immigrants:</strong></p>   <blockquote class="edTag">   <p>Right now, 50% of our new recruits are high school graduates. But when you look at the actual labor market, only 15% to 20% of the labor market are people with just high school degrees.&nbsp;</p>   <p>So there is a much bigger pool that we need to be fishing in, if you will. So a lot of the changes we're going to make are aimed at helping our recruiters be able to talk to people who have gone beyond high school.</p>   </blockquote>   <strong>.</strong></p>   <hr>   <p><strong>On declining American trust in the military:</strong></p>   <blockquote class="edTag">   <p>I think if you look at polling, Americans' trust in institutions has been declining steadily. </p>   <p>Other than small businesses, the United States military is the most respected institution. So Americans still, I think, have a huge amount of trust in the military.&nbsp;</p>   <p>But I do think that we're suffering under the same dynamics as many other places. And I think Americans look and see a fair amount of dysfunction in our government. Obviously, I think the legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan is a factor for people.</p>   </blockquote>

I mean, I believe in the product, if you will."</li>   </ul>   </li>   <li></li>   <li></li>   </ul>
