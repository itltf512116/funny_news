   <p>A Black high school student in Texas  was removed from his school on Wednesday and transferred to an alternative school.</p>   <p>Darryl George, a junior at Barbers Hill High School in Mont Belvieu (a town roughly 30 miles outside of Houston) will be placed in a disciplinary alternative education program through Nov. 29, according to a notice sent from the school district and shared by the student's family.</p>   <p>The notice, dated Wednesday, addressed to Darryl's mother, Darresha George, and signed by Barbers Hill High School Principal Lance Murphy, cites violations of "multiple infractions of campus and classroom rules" including:</p>   <ul class="edTag">   <li>Disruption of the in-school suspension<strong> </strong>classroom; </li>   <li>Failure to comply with directives from staff/administration; </li>   <li>Violation of tardy policy; and</li>   <li>Violation of the dress and grooming policy.</li>   </ul>

   <p>"As the School Principal, I have determined that your child has engaged in chronic or repeated disciplinary infractions that violate the District's previously communicated standards of student conduct," Murphy said in the notice obtained by NPR.</p>   <p>Darryl, who turned 18 last week, wears his natural hair in locs, which he says are an "expression of cultural pride," according to a  against Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the state's attorney general and the school district.</p>   <p>Allie Booker, an attorney representing the George family, told NPR that the recent move by the school district is simply "retaliation."</p>

   <p>Candice Matthews, a civil rights activist and spokeswoman for the George family, said Darryl feels scared as he stands in front of the building for the alternative school. </p>   <p>She also said that Darryl still does not plan to cut his hair.</p>   <p>"Why do they hate us so much? Our skin is our sin," Matthews told NPR.</p>
