   <p>A revolt by a small group of hard-line Republicans has left the House without an elected speaker and, as a result, unable to do legislative business.</p>   <p>It spent much of last week on recess, and isn't expected to reconvene to vote on a new speaker until midweek at the earliest. It's not clear how long that process will take.</p>

   <p>U.S. law has long prohibited foreign aid money from being used for abortions.
