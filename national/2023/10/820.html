                Marching bands are getting creative to beat the heat of climate change. Some changes include covering brass instruments under direct sunlight, scheduling frequent water breaks and time to put on extra sunscreen, no longer wearing traditional marching band uniforms at games and practicing before sunrise or after sunset.

   <p>It's a Thursday evening in late September. The marching band at Mountain Ridge High School in the Phoenix metro area is an hour into rehearsal, and the students are all warmed up — musically, and physically.</p>   <p>The 170 high schoolers aren't in usual marching band gear like constructed jackets, bibs and shakos with plumes. Instead, they're dressed in matching white T-shirts and athletic shorts — what they've been practicing in all season due to the warmer, 100-degree weather.</p>   <p>All around the U.S. this fall, students and educators have been struggling with extreme heat. Schools have responded on many levels, from  to changing hours to . And for marching bands, this new climate is no longer just a question of comfort.</p>

   <p>Vogel and his students are no strangers to performing in the heat, but even for them, he says, there hasn't been a season as gross and grueling as this one.</p>   <p>"This is my 10th year of teaching in Phoenix," he says, "and I never recall there being a moment over 110 [degrees] at 6 p.m., but that has happened multiple times this year."</p>   <h3 class="edTag">Heat exhaustion and sunburn are serious threats</h3>   <p>"We've seen it almost every day in our health offices — kids coming out with heat exhaustion — and last year, it wasn't this common," says Rachel Howard, a school nurse and a board member of the School Nurses Organization of Arizona.</p>

                Mountain Ridge High School near Phoenix starts marching band practice at 7 p.m. to beat the heat of the day. Band members also wear light clothing and take frequent water breaks.

   <p>Back in Arizona, Rick McEnaney is the marching band director at Flagstaff High School, a couple of hours north of Phoenix. Because of the higher altitude in Flagstaff, McEnaney says, the band practices in "significantly cooler" temperatures than in Phoenix — meaning in the 90s rather than the 110s.</p>            
                        <h3 class="slug"></h3>

   <p>One silver lining for these educators in already warmer regions is that they've got some of this figured out. Vogel says this year for the first time, band directors in other states have reached out and asked for advice on weathering the heat.</p>   <p>"We do have a few mantras that we say," he says. "On days that it's really hot, we'll ask the students, 'Hey, how hot is it outside?' And the kids all respond in unison: 'It's 72 degrees with a cool breeze.'"</p>   <p>Vogel says there's always a way of having mind over matter. But in this warming world, a positive mindset alone is no longer enough to keep the band kids safe and spirited.</p>
