   <h3 class="edTag">1. We're in uncharted territory</h3>   <p>First, a bit of context.</p>   <p>McCarthy was elected speaker in January after 15 rounds of voting. He managed to finally secure the gavel, in part by agreeing to demands from a fringe group of Republicans to change the rules on who can propose a resolution to remove the speaker — allowing just one member to do it.</p>   as evidence he had not  to conservatives.</p>   <p>As McCarthy's allies urged calm during Tuesday's debate, saying a vote to vacate the speaker could "plunge [the House] into chaos," Gaetz was quick to turn blame around.</p>   <p>"Chaos is Speaker McCarthy. Chaos is somebody who we cannot trust with their word," Gaetz said.</p>

                Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., led the charge against McCarthy.

   <p>While Gaetz is the face of the rebellion and the de facto leader of the opposition Republicans who voted against McCarthy, the majority of members of the Republican conference in the House stood by their elected leader.</p>   <p>Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a McCarthy supporter, told  the vote to vacate the speakership was "disappointing and frustrating," adding that she believed Gaetz was driven by personal animosity and was President Biden's "favorite Republican" because "he's siding with the Democrats."</p>   <hr>   <p><strong>For all the latest developments on this story, </strong><strong> from 4 p.m. ET.</strong></p>   <hr>   <h3 class="edTag">2. The Republican Party didn't plan for this</h3>   <p>The House will be forced to hold a vote on a new speaker, but it's not clear who could win enough votes to secure the position.</p>

   <p>Republican strategist Ron Bonjean told  this isn't how most Republicans would have liked to see this play out.</p>   <p>"I am really shocked on one hand, and on the other hand, it's rather surprising that [McCarthy] lasted this long considering the current dynamics in the House," he said.</p>   <p>He said he didn't believe the group of eight Republicans that voted with Democrats to oust McCarthy had a plan beyond that move.</p>   <p>"And I think that's what's most concerning of all, is that they did this out of retribution for him going ahead and funding the U.S. government," Bonjean said, in reference to the short-term spending bill that was agreed to at the weekend.</p>   <p>It's a point echoed by Miller-Meeks, who said her Republican colleagues asked Gaetz who he wanted to replace McCarthy as speaker, but didn't get a name.</p>   <p>"He has no individual. He has no person," Miller-Meeks said.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">3. The Democrats chose not to save McCarthy</h3>   <p>Before the vote, there was some speculation that Democrats might step in to save McCarthy by voting "present" rather than in favor of the motion to vacate. </p>   <p>But in the end, McCarthy didn't offer them any concessions and Democrats voted to have him removed.</p>

   <p>Democrats say they will now put forward Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries for speaker — as they did in the rounds of voting in January — but he will almost certainly fall short again in the Republican-majority House.</p>   <p>Leon Panetta, a former Democratic House member and director of the CIA, told  that McCarthy was a "failed leader."</p>   <p>"The reason he failed is because too often he capitulated to his opponents, and ultimately lost his credibility and his trust as a result of that, in the hope that ultimately his opponents would somehow be loyal to him," he said. "I think in doing that, he really undermined his credibility as speaker and that cost him."</p>   <strong> from 4 p.m. ET.</strong></p>   <hr>   <p class="contributors-text"></p>
