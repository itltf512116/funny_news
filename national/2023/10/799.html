                The Synod on Synodality gathering at the Vatican could be defining for Pope Francis. Key agenda items include women's role in the church and welcoming divorced Catholics and LGBTQ+ Catholics.

   <p>For more than a dozen years, Jazmin Jimenez was a Catholic-school teacher. It was a job she loved but one that also highlighted certain contradictions. Among them, teaching her students that the church excludes women from the sacrament of ordination to the priesthood.</p>   <p>"We told them that we all have a common dignity and a common mission," she says. "And then you fast-forward to a course on sacraments, and we say, 'Oh, yeah, well, but not here.'"</p>   <p>Her students noticed the contradictions too, as have a lot of younger Catholics who live in a world where equality of opportunity among the sexes is believed to be a given.</p>

   <p>What came out in those sessions was sent up to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and then on to the Vatican. The same process happened at tens of thousands of parishes around the world. Jimenez says the conversations with her fellow Catholics clarified something for her.</p>   <p>"If women were allowed to be deacons in the Catholic Church, absolutely, tomorrow I would seriously discern and consider becoming a deacon," she says. "It is a pain point for me that that is not something that I am able to discern at this time."</p>

                The workspace for the Synod on Synodality is the Vatican's Paul VI Hall. Pope Francis will preside at the global gathering of bishops and laypeople to discuss the future of the Catholic Church.

   <p>Deacons are not priests and cannot preside at communion or hear confessions. But they are official leaders who preach, teach and baptize — something Faggioli says women already do in many Catholic parishes.</p>   <p>"We allow you to do these things as long as you don't ask to be formally acknowledged," he says. "So many of us think that it's time to get rid of this hypocrisy."</p>   <p>Around the world, the Catholic Church is experiencing an extreme shortage in priests — a shortage that could be eased by allowing women to serve as deacons. Many scholars argue that women deacons would not, in fact, be a new idea but rather the recovery of an ancient tradition.</p>

   <p>"Make sure that there's room in the tent for everyone," he says. "They want to hear their pastors say that to them — that you're welcomed. Where you can come and find our Lord and find each other and find an honor and respect for each other."</p>   <p>Torgerson says "everyone" includes divorced Catholics as well as gays and lesbians. He points to this synod as an example of the difference between Francis and his predecessors, who were more rule-bound than pastoral.</p>   <p>He smiles broadly as he quotes a saying from Francis: "Pastors, smell like your sheep."</p>   <p>For Torgerson, that means knowing what his flock cares about and worries about and knowing what those in the pews each Sunday long for the church to be.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">A defining moment for Pope Francis</h3>   <p>Participants gathering in Rome through Oct. 29 will talk and listen to each other, but they won't vote on any positions or issue any documents at this time.</p>

   <p>The church's more recent openness to dialogue, embodied in this synod, has been revolutionary for lifelong Catholic Lupita Perez. It's a life she divides into the time of Francis and the time before he became pope.</p>   <p>"In the before time," she says, "I need to be honest with you — I wasn't very much involved in my community and my church, in my relationship with the church."</p>   <p>Now, Perez is an active member of Our Lady of Guadalupe in San Diego, where she serves as a youth minister. She's in Rome this week for the opening of the synod.</p>   <p>Perez says all this talking and all this listening makes her hopeful but cautious. She knows that the church is slow to change, and she worries failure to move forward on at least some of the issues being tackled by the synod would be heartbreaking.</p>   <p>"Some may be listening," she says, "but are you really, really open to the change?"</p>
