   <p>In the scheme, prosecutors accuse Santos of running a credit card fraud scheme using his political donors' credit cards, while also allegedly attempting to scam the national Republican Party. </p>   <p>"Santos is charged with stealing people's identities and making charges on his own donors' credit cards without their authorization," said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace  Tuesday.</p>   <p>This expanded indictment comes  to felony charges linked to her work for his campaign.  </p>

   <p>Marks faces up to five years in prison.

   <p>Santos remains a member in full standing of the Republican caucus, though he's been .   </p>   <p>Santos has denied any criminal wrongdoing, and pleaded not guilty in May to the original charges. He was released on a $500,000 bond. He also faces a House ethics probe but announced he's running for re-election next year. </p>   <p>In  this week on social media, Santos said he plans to back Rep. Jim Jordan in the fight for the Speaker's gavel. Despite scandals and criminal charges, he could serve as a key vote in the bitterly divided chamber.   </p>   <aside id="ad-secondary-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">
