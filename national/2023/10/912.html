   <p>In the scheme, prosecutors accuse Santos of running a credit card fraud scheme using his political donors' credit cards, while also allegedly attempting to scam the national Republican Party. </p>   <p>"Santos is charged with stealing people's identities and making charges on his own donors' credit cards without their authorization," said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace  Tuesday.</p>   <p>This expanded indictment comes  to felony charges linked to her work for his campaign.  </p>

Jim Jordan in the fight for the Speaker's gavel.
