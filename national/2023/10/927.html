   <p>The six conservative members of the Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed likely to dash Democratic hopes for a chance to win a second congressional seat in South Carolina. </p>   <p>At issue was the way the Republican-controlled state legislature drew new congressional maps after the decennial census. The case is particularly important because race and partisanship so often overlap, especially in racially polarized states like South Carolina. And while the court ruled in 2019 that partisan gerrymanders do not violate the Constitution, the justices have also ruled that racial gerrymanders do.  </p>   <p>Specifically at issue in Wednesday's case was the way the GOP legislature evened out the population between Congressional District 1, CD 1, which encompassed Charleston County and had 88,000  voters, and neighboring CD 6, represented by the state's only Black congressman, which had  voters. Now, you might think that the easy solution would be to move the excess voters from CD1 to CD6. Instead, though, the GOP plan chopped up Charleston County, stripping from CD1 much of the city of Charleston and ending its 120-year history as the anchor for the district. </p>

   <p>Justice Samuel Alito interjected, saying that the clear error standard "doesn't mean we simply rubber stamp findings by the district court."</p>   <p>And the conservative justices, including Roberts, did question the lower court's conclusion that the legislature had targeted Black voters.</p>   <p>"When race and partisanship are so closely aligned, said, Alito, "it isn't surprising that that when you want to get a district that has a certain Republican percentage," you're going to have fewer Black voters. </p>   <p>He and several of the conservatives criticized the NAACP for not producing an alternative map. But Justice Elena Kagan, reading from the court's key decision on this point, countered that there is no alternative map requirement. It "doesn't exist," she said. </p>

   <p>Chief Justice Roberts clearly was displeased. Has the solicitor general's office "ever supported the plaintiffs in a case in which there was no evidence of any direct discrimination, no alternative maps, no oddly shaped districts. And a volume, a volume of political data?" he asked. "Can you think of one [example] where your office has done that before?" </p>   <p>No, replied Flynn.</p>   <p>But moments later, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked if it would be legal for the legislature to use race as a proxy for achieving a political goal. If it couldn't get the safer Republican district it wanted without using race, was it free to use race as a proxy? No, replied Flynn. "You can't use race as a proxy for a political goal." </p>   <aside id="ad-third-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>"So the bottom line is," said Sotomayor, that the GOP legislature "had created maps that kept CD 1 Republican-leaning," but not safe Republican, "and they chose not to use them. For whatever other political reasons, what they went back to was [using] race" to get the safe Republican district they wanted. "Yes," replied Flynn, "That is what the district court held."</p>
