   <p>Abortion rights supporters here have been inspired by the success of their counterparts  last year where abortion was on the ballot. Smith says they worked for months to get enough signatures to put their own ballot question before Ohio voters. </p>   <p>But they soon ran into another obstacle. </p>   <p>"Then it was, 'oh, by the way, you have a month, and then there's going to be this election that's going to decide everything,'" Smith remembered.  </p>   <p>Republican lawmakers in Ohio called a  in August on another measure — also called Issue 1 — that would have changed the rules and made it harder for the abortion rights amendment to pass. </p>   <p>Ohio voters turned out in numbers to reject that effort, leaving the threshold for passing an amendment at a simple majority.</p>

   <p>Ohioans are making this decision in a state where a strict abortion ban is waiting in the wings.</p>   <p>The law  in court bans most abortions after about six weeks and contains no exceptions for rape or incest. It briefly took effect last year after the  decision overturned decades of abortion rights precedent — long enough for a 10-year-old rape victim to make  after being forced to travel to neighboring Indiana for an abortion. </p>   <p>"What happened to that 10-year-old girl, let's be clear, was absolutely tragic," said Amy Natoce, press secretary for the anti-abortion group Protect Women Ohio. "I think everybody can agree on that."</p>

   <p>Natoce, whose organization is leading the effort to defeat Issue 1, says she's grateful that the girl's rapist was caught and prosecuted. But she stops short of saying that the girl should have had access to abortion in her home state. </p>   <p>"That is up to the voters and the legislature to decide," Natoce added. "If Issue 1 passes, the conversation ends."</p>
