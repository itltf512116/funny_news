   <p>Nordean's sister and wife spoke on his behalf arguing mercy for a good person, they said. <strong><br/><br/></strong>When it was his turn to address the court, Nordean expressed regret for those who were injured and killed during and after Jan. 6. </p>   <p>"No rally should hold value over anyone's life," Nordean said in court.</p>   <p>Nordean, from Auburn, Wa., admitted to being a leader of the Proud Boys on that day, but said, "I came to keep people safe." However, he noted, he had several opportunties to deescalate the situation.</p>   <p>"I chose to do nothing," he said.</p>   <p>In his plea to Judge Kelly and before his outburst, Pezzola, of Rochester, N.Y., was far more emotional. He said he stood before the court "a changed man."</p>   <p>He cried as he addressed his two daughters and his wife. He expressed deep regret for leaving his wife to care for their family and for missing major events in his daughters' lives. </p>   <p>To Judge Kelly he said: "I stand before you with a heart full of regret."</p>   <p>He said, regarding his actions on Jan. 6, "This was the worst, most regrettable decision of my life. I fully realize the gravity of my actions."</p>

   <h3 class="edTag">The last of the Proud Boys await sentencing</h3>   <p>Kelly had previously said that he weighed the sentences of other Jan. 6 defendants and was working to avoid large sentencing disparities. This is part of why he gave sentences far below guidelines and the government's recommendations. </p>   <p>But one of Pezzola's defense attorneys, Roger Roots, filed a late sentencing memoranda for his client the morning of the hearing. In the filing, Roots warned against "a growing danger in Federal Courts of severe sentencing disparities" between Jan. 6 rioters and "left wing rioters."</p>   <p>Kelly said sentencing is a "serious and solemn thing," that the tardy filing was "inappropriate" given its lateness and struck it from the record. </p>   <p>The sentencing hearings for Tarrio and Nordean, originally scheduled for Wednesday, were delayed after Kelly fell ill.</p>   <p>Tarrio's hearing will commence on Tuesday, Sept. 5.</p>
