                Teresa Casados runs New Mexico's Children, Youth & Families Department. She discovered the state had been taking the Social Security checks of children in foster care — children who got the benefits because they were orphaned or disabled.

   <p>To Teresa Casados, who runs the department in charge of child welfare in New Mexico, it seemed like an odd question. At a legislative hearing in July, a lawmaker asked her if the state was taking the Social Security checks of kids in foster care — the checks intended for orphans and disabled children.</p>   <p>"My reaction really was: That can't be right," said Casados, who in the spring took over as acting secretary of New Mexico's Children, Youth & Families Department. "That can't be a practice that we're doing."</p>   <p>Casados and her chief legal counsel drove back to the office. "When we got back, we looked into it and found out it was a practice that the agency had for using those benefits — and had been going on for quite some time."</p>    by NPR and The Marshall Project found this practice was the rule across the country. The investigation led to calls for reform. Now, 15 states and cities have taken steps to preserve the money of foster youth. Several other state legislatures are considering similar laws.</p>   <p>And last month, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Social Security Administration sent to state and local child welfare agencies to encourage these changes.</p>   
            
                           
                        <h3 class="slug"></h3>

   <p>The NPR/Marshall Project investigation found that  when young people go into foster care child, welfare agencies routinely look for which ones come with Social Security checks. Or, if the children are eligible, agencies sign them up for benefits. Then state agencies cash those checks — usually without telling the child or their family, the investigation found.</p>   <p>States claim the money as reimbursement for the costs of foster care. But governments already have an obligation to pay the costs of foster care under state and federal laws. The result is that only impoverished kids, who receive Social Security benefits because they're orphans or because they're disabled or their parents are disabled, get a bill for their own foster care.</p>

                Justin Kasieta, who is 22 now, was just 13 when his father died and he was thrust into a role looking after his four younger siblings. In college, he interned in the state legislature and the U.S. Congress.

   <p>So he knew the family's finances, and that their income came from Social Security — from survivors benefits checks.</p>   <p>It helped them get by in their small town on Michigan's Upper Peninsula.</p>   <p>A couple of years later, Kasieta went into foster care and the state of Michigan took his checks to reimburse the cost of that care.</p>   <p>That didn't seem right to Kasieta.</p>   <p>"The main argument would be that it's not fair to make kids who are orphaned or disabled have to pay for their own foster care," he says. "But then kids who are not orphaned or disabled, they receive taxpayer dollars to cover their foster care?"</p>   <p>Kasieta relied upon scholarships and grants to go to college. He says those Social Security checks could have helped.</p>   <p>Last month, he graduated from the University of Michigan. He has job possibilities in finance and in government.</p>   <p>And he's advocating for a bill in front of the legislature in Michigan — to save Social Security benefits for children and youths in foster care.</p>   <aside id="ad-overflow-3-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>"If the goal is to make success stories like mine the rule, instead of the exception, I think that we need to support kids all the way through from the time they are in foster care to the time they exit foster care and even beyond that," he said.</p>
