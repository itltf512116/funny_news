                Reza Baluchi was taken in by the U.S. Coast Guard last week while trying to cross the Atlantic in a "hydro pod" made of buoys. Authorities in Flagler County, Fla., responded to Baluchi and his vessel in 2021 and posted photos of his vessel on Facebook.

   <p>Try as he might, Reza Baluchi can't reach his destination without running afoul of the U.S. Coast Guard. </p>   <p>The key problem is his vessel: a giant floating hamster wheel made of buoys and wire, self-propelled by Baluchi running inside. </p>   <p>Baluchi, who lives in Florida after being granted asylum from Iran, was taken in by the Coast Guard last week aboard his vessel, following several days of back and forth with the authorities.</p>   <p>According to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. district court in South Florida, the Coast Guard cutter  came across Baluchi and his homemade vessel about 70 nautical miles east of Tybee Island, Ga., on August 26 as the Coast Guard was preparing for Hurricane Franklin. </p>    in  as he began a quest to run across the country, Forrest Gump-style. He  finished the coast-to-coast journey not once but twice. <strong> </strong></p>   <p>He was also the focus of  from VICE about Baluchi's 2014 and 2016 attempts to travel from Boca Raton, Fla., to Bermuda – a distance of more than 1,000 miles – by running inside his homemade floating bubble. </p>   <p>In the video, Baluchi explains his motivation in using unusual means of travel: "If you drive a boat, nobody cares. Bubble, nobody did before."</p>

   <p>Todd Coggeshall, formerly of the U.S. Coast Guard, recalled what happened during the 2014 attempt, which he called "by far the most bizarre case that I was involved with."</p>   <p>"One of our sectors, Sector Miami, got a call from a concerned boater that there was a man in a bubble that was lost and was asking for directions to Bermuda," Coggeshall told VICE. "It became really obvious really fast that he wasn't a sailor, didn't know the ocean, and was unequipped to do what he was attempting to do."</p>   he turned on the beacon accidentally.) The Captain of the Port of Miami ordered Baluchi not to attempt to travel to Bermuda in his bubble.</p>   <p>Baluchi tried again in 2016. This time, the Coast Guard came upon Baluchi, told him they were terminating his voyage for being manifestly unsafe, and that he should embark their boat.</p>   <p>"Make me crazy," Baluchi is seen telling the Coast Guard officers. "I've been five years, like, do this thing. They stop me every time, they save my life. I don't no need it, save my life. I don't no need it."</p>   <p>He told the officers that he had five or six lights and two life jackets. "I have a GPS. I have a laptop [to] watch movie," Baluchi protested. But the officers said his voyage was unsafe and based on the Captain of the Port order and his physical condition, the officers hauled him in.</p>   <p>And they sank his bubble as a hazard to navigation. "They shot, they sink my bubble," Baluchi told VICE. "No more bubble I have." With it sank all off his supplies. Coggeshall said the cost to taxpayers for the Coast Guard response was about $144,000.</p>    shows his interaction with the responding officers from the Flagler County Sheriff's Office. "Where are you supposed to land?" the officer asks. </p>   <p>"I'm going to New York," Baluchi says, his giant hamster wheel on the beach behind him.</p>   <p>"Did you start on a bigger vessel?" the officer asks. Baluchi looks at him blankly and says, "Huh?"</p>   <p>"Were you on a bigger vessel or is this all you have?" the officer asks.</p>   <p>"This is all I have," says Baluchi.</p>   <p>Baluchi now faces charges of Obstruction of Boarding, and Violation of a Captain of the Port Order. </p>   <p>Whether it will be enough to keep Baluchi on land remains to be seen. </p>   <p>"Dream no coming after you," Baluchi told VICE. "You must follow your dream."</p>
