   <p>The Biden administration is canceling the only seven oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The leases were originally issued by the Trump administration over the protests of environmentalists and some Alaska Native groups who argue the region should be protected as a critical wildlife habitat. </p>   <p>In January 2021, nine leases covering more than 430,000 acres were issued by the Trump administration; the Biden administration has already canceled and refunded two of the leases at the request of the leaseholders. The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state-owned economic development corporation, owned the remaining seven leases — this action applies to those tracts. </p>

   <p>The White House also announced new protections for millions of acres across Alaska's North Slope and in the Arctic Ocean. Over 13 million acres in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A), a vast swath of land on Alaska's North Slope, will be off limits to oil and gas drilling, r.</p>   <p>While the new regulations will block new oil and gas leases in the protected areas, they will not block the development of existing leases in the NPR-A, including ConocoPhillips' controversial Willow Project. </p>   .</p>   <p>Alaska oil drilling projects have been top of mind for both the administration and voters this year. The latest announcement comes several months after resulting in blowback to the administration.</p>   <p>Most recently, Elise Joshi, a climate activist with the group Gen Z for Change, i to confront the administration specifically with concerns about the Willow project.</p>   <p>But the administration insisted the new protections are separate from decisions about the Willow Project.</p>   <p>"These are two entirely different processes," a senior administration official said on Wednesday. </p>   <p>Its approval has raised concerns from other young voters, who than their older counterparts. </p>
