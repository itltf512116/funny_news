                A satellite image from around daybreak Wednesday shows Hurricane Lee spinning over open water between Puerto Rico and Bermuda. The projected path has it bringing high wind and storm surge to the Northeast this weekend.

   <p>The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for part of the Maine coast Wednesday afternoon as Hurricane Lee lost some strength but grew in size.</p>   <p>The hurricane watch extends up the Maine coast from Stonington to the U.S.-Canada border. Forecasters said that area could see hurricane conditions on Saturday.</p>   <p>The center also issued a tropical storm watch for a large area of coastal New England from Watch Hill, R.I., to Stonington, including Block Island, R.I., and Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket in Massachusetts. That area could see tropical storm conditions beginning Friday night.</p>

                Hurricane Lee is expected to speed up its forward motion as it turns more to the north. While its winds will weaken, the large storm will pose flooding and other threats, forecasters say.

   <p>Early Wednesday morning, Lee was moving northwest at a virtual crawl of just 6 mph. It has now started to speed up and is expected to continue that trend into the weekend. It is also expected to continue to lose strength slowly over that time.</p>   <p>The storm will likely show "significant weakening" by this weekend as it runs into unfavorable conditions, including cooler waters north of the Gulf Stream. </p>   <p>As it loses steam, Lee is expected to complete an  "before the cyclone's center reaches the coast of Maine, New Brunswick, or Nova Scotia in about 4 days," the NHC said. </p>   <p>But even as it noted that welcome development, the center cautioned, "Lee's expected post-tropical transition will not diminish potential wind, rain, and coastal flooding impacts in New England and Atlantic Canada due to the system's broad wind field."</p>    on Wednesday, warning that people on and around the island could see average wind speeds from 34 to 63 knots (39 to 72.5 mph), along with "significant waves & swell."</p>   <p>Local conditions are expected to start to improve by Friday, the agency said.</p>
