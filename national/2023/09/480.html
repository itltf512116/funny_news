   <p>"In the beginning, we were prepping for the short game," supervisor of the U.S. Marshals fugitive task force for eastern Pennsylvania, Robert Clark, said on Monday. "Now, we're planning for the long game."</p>   <p>So what is that long game, and what tools do investigators have at their disposal?</p>   <p>"It becomes an all-hands-on-deck situation," Major Brent Davison of the New York State Police told . "Pretty much all federal, state and local agencies respond to the area, and it becomes a unified command." </p>

   <p>And heat isn't the only hindrance. Davison said rural areas are challenging to search, with acres and acres of woods and no houses.</p>   <p>"We had no cell phone coverage in most of the area," he said of the 2015 manhunt. "Even our radios – police radios worked in a spotty manner."</p>   <p>And there are non technology tools at investigators' disposal too — like bloodhounds.</p>   <p>"They would be critical in helping to locate people that are out in the woods," Davison said.</p>   <p>Yet they also have their limits. Loki, one of the dogs involved in the hunt for Cavalcante, suffered a heat-related illness during the search and had to be taken to the vet.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">No shelter orders</h3>   <p>Roughly 500 law enforcement personnel are involved in the search and authorities say Cavalcante is considered extremely dangerous.</p>   <p>A school district in the area canceled classes on Tuesday and residents are being urged to call 911 if they see Cavalcante, but have not been ordered to shelter in place.</p>   <p>The 34-year-old Brazil native was convicted this year of murdering his ex-girlfriend in 2021; he was sentenced to life behind bars without the possibility of parole. Cavalcante's brazen escape can be seen on jail surveillance video, in which he "crab-walked" between two exterior walls, ran across a roof and managed to get through razor wire.</p>   <aside id="ad-third-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">
