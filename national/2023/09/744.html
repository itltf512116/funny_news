   <p>Menendez has so far , claiming his innocence. He has only agreed to temporarily step down from his post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>   <p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Wednesday that Menendez will address the Democratic Caucus tomorrow. </p>   <p>Schumer has not called on Menendez to resign.</p>   <p>"Like you, I was just deeply disappointed and disturbed when I read the indictment," he said Wednesday. "I've known Sen Menendez a very long time and it was truly, truly upsetting. But we all know that for senators there's a much, much higher standard. And clearly, when you read the indictment, Senator Menendez fell way, way below that standard."</p>   <p>Nadine Menendez was released on $250,000 bail with her travel restricted as well. </p>   <p>Menendez, 69, and his wife, Nadine, 56, are facing charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, attempt and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud and conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right, according to court documents.</p>   <p>Their alleged coconspirators, New Jersey businessmen Fred Daibes, a real estate developer, Wael Hana and Joseph Uribe were also named in that same indictment and are facing two charges each.</p>   <p>Hana pleaded not guilty on Tuesday.</p>
