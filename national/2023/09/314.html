   <p>A headless bronze statue, believed to depict Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, has belonged to the Cleveland Museum of Art for nearly 40 years. But soon, the artifact will be in New York where authorities will investigate whether it was stolen from Turkey.</p>   <p>The life-size statue is over 6 feet tall, about 1,800 years old and valued at $20 million. It is believed to be one of many antiquities looted from Bubon, in southwest Turkey, and trafficked in Manhattan decades ago. </p>
