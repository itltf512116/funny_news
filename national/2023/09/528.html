   <p>Child poverty in the U.S.  in a year, and we have a pretty clear idea what drove it: Congress let the expanded child tax credit expire.</p>   <p>It's rare for a government policy to have an immediate and measurable impact on an individual or large portion of the population. But experts say the monthly payments to low-income families with children were doing just that.</p>   <p>After the expanded credit took effect, child poverty hit a historic low of 5.2% a year ago. New Census data shows it has since rocketed to 12.4%.</p>   <p>Doctors are seeing this play out in real time.</p>   <strong>.</strong></p>   <hr>   , in 2021, Congress increased the amount of the child tax credit as part of the American Rescue Plan. It also expanded eligibility to include millions more low-income families. </li>   <li>Experts and parents reported measurable relief, but the move was temporary and wasn't renewed.</li>   <li>The recent rapid rise in child poverty coincided with other factors — like record inflation — but  the end of the expanded child tax credit was a key factor.</li>   </ul>

   <p><strong>What is Sandel seeing now?</strong></p>   <p>Sandel says she is most concerned about stunted growth, weight loss and poor performance in school among the kids she treats. </p>   <blockquote class="edTag">   <p>What we're starting to see is kids flatlining, kids who should be growing, should be gaining weight, should be, frankly, growing the brain that they need for the rest of their lives. And we're seeing kids not grow. We're seeing kids lose weight. Which when you're 3 or 4 years old, that is a medical emergency. What's going on? And a lot of times when we really dig deeper, it's simply because people can't afford enough food and are stretching beyond what they can deal with.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Sandel does call out inflation and the rising cost of housing for adding an additional burden to already struggling families. But she says effective policy can help families navigate those factors. </p>   <blockquote class="edTag">   <p>And so what I don't want people to walk away from is to say, "Oh, well, inflation, it doesn't matter if you give people more money, it's just going to be spent and it won't travel as far." I do think that in many ways, it really is about the positive effects of putting money in people's pockets.</p>   </blockquote>   <p><strong>How does this make her feel as a pediatrician?</strong></p>   <p>Mostly, Sandel says she doesn't understand why the policy was allowed to expire. </p>   <blockquote class="edTag">   <p>We have something that worked really, really well. And so I want to ask, what are the ways in which, you know, we can say to ourselves, this is worthy of investment? Because what I like to say is I can do my best role as a physician to help kids grow. But what I need is policymakers to do their job to be able to help kids grow, too. And that is really in their hands.</p>   </blockquote>   , the child poverty rates have also fueled political debate over bringing back an expanded child tax credit — although it's been at a stalemate in Congress. </li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p>   <ul class="edTag">   <li></li>   <li></li>   <li></li>   </ul>
