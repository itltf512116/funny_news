   <p>President Biden and first lady Jill Biden got to see the damage from Hurricane Idalia up close as they toured the northern Florida city of Live Oak on Saturday. </p>   <p>The city, which is located a little over an hour northeast of where the storm made landfall early Wednesday as Category 3 hurricane with 125 mph winds, was one of the hardest hit areas. </p>   <p>Following both an aerial and walking tour of the damaged area, as well as meet-and-greets with first responders and those affected by the destruction, Biden told a crowd of onlookers and reporters that the spirit of the community "is remarkable."</p>

   <p>While an initial cost of the damage wrought by the storm has yet to be released by the government,  Idalia is going to cost Florida and Georgia between $12 to $20 billion in damage.</p>   <p> power restoration is ongoing with 90% of the power that was knocked out by Hurricane Idalia having been restored as of Saturday afternoon.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, agencies from all levels of government continue to work on recovery efforts. Biden assured residents that the federal government wasn't going anywhere. </p>   <p>"Now the storm has passed and you're dealing with what's in its wake ... we're here to help the state long as it takes," he said.</p>
