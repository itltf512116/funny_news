   <p></p>   <hr>   <p>In 2013, Alie Ward's life was falling apart. In quick succession, her relationship with her partner ended, her dad was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, and she was feeling increasingly unhappy in her job.</p>   <p>"I remember days when I would think, 'I only cried four times today.' That was a good day for me," Ward said.</p>   <p>Ward lived in Los Angeles at the time. To distract herself from her woes, she liked to find and take pictures of her unconventional obsession: bugs. Sometimes, if she found a beetle or a bee that she particularly liked, she'd post it to Facebook. Those posts attracted the attention of a woman named Lila Higgins, who worked as an entomologist at the local natural history museum. After seeing Ward's pictures, Higgins reached out to see if she would want a tour of the museum's insectary.</p>            
                        <h3 class="slug"></h3>

   <p>When Ward arrived at the museum, Higgins greeted her at the back door.</p>   <p>"Lila had no idea what I was going through in my life at that time," Ward remembered. "I think she probably didn't expect someone jittery and tear-stained to meet her at the back door of this museum."</p>   <p>Higgins handed Ward a lab coat and led her through the different exhibits.</p>   <p>"I remember she opened up this freezer, like, 'Come check this out,' and it was full of dead bugs. ... And I just remember just how excited she was about everything. [It] was such a pass for me to get excited about this in her company and really rediscover what excited me in life."</p>   <p>For the first time in ages, Ward felt herself light up. Higgins noticed her enthusiasm and suggested Ward volunteer at the museum for a few hours every week.</p>   <aside id="ad-secondary-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>"She just knew that I could possibly be happy there, and maybe I would have something to offer," Ward remembered. "But at the time I really felt like I didn't have a lot to offer many people. I was a wreck. I was crying constantly and I was really preoccupied."</p>   <p>Despite her doubts, Ward decided to sign up. Every Wednesday she'd arrive at the museum. And with each volunteer shift, she felt a little bit better.</p>   <p>"It gave me this sense of purpose. It helped me reconnect with my love of science and nature that I'd always had, that I really put on the back burner to chase these career ambitions that were really not that authentic to me," Ward said.</p>   <p>Soon, Ward quit her job and started working in science media. She now is the creator and host of a podcast called . Ward had Higgins on the show as her first guest.</p>   <p>"She has caused such an exponential effect in my life. It was really because of her that I was able to reconnect with that part of myself, change my career course and do something that I really love," Ward said. "Sometimes I shudder when I think about what would have happened if I didn't take her up on that. What would my life have been like? Who would I be? You know, Lila Higgins in one instant changed my whole life."</p>   <p></p>
