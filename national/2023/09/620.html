                Simone Biles continues to soar: 10 years after putting elite gymnastics on notice, she's now heading to her sixth World Championships. Biles is seen here during the floor routine at last month's U.S. Gymnastics Championships.

   <p>It's 2013 all over again for Simone Biles. One month after winning her , Biles punched her ticket to the upcoming World Championships by posting the top all-around score at a U.S. qualifying competition.</p>   <p>"Going back to where it all began!" USA Gymnastics , referring to the Sportpaleis arena in Antwerp, Belgium — where Biles won two gold medals at the World Championships 10 years ago.</p>   <p>Biles, 26, is now the  ever selected for six World Championships squads. </p>   <h3 class="edTag">Biles took first in an extremely close competition</h3>   <p>locked in her spot on the U.S. squad by taking the top spot in a "nail-biting competition that came down to the final rotation," USA Gymnastics said of the event held in Katy, Texas. </p>    on Balance Beam at the Women’s Selection Camp Competition! |  |  </p>&mdash; USA Gymnastics (@USAGym) </blockquote>

   <p>As that final turn began, Biles was third behind Kaliya Lincoln and Shi Jones. But she was also heading to the vault, a traditional strength for Biles. She came away with a less-than-perfect 14.550 — but Jones was unable to capitalize in her bars routine, when her feet touched the mat.</p>   <p>Biles took first place — and guaranteed a trip to worlds — with her score of 55.700. Jones came in second with 55.300, and Skye Blakely was third with 55.000.</p>   <p>The competition did not include , the all-around champion at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

   <p>Biles has won 19 World gold medals — more than any other gymnast in history — and  (also a record). The competition is held each year, except those that coincide with an Olympics.</p>   <p>There aren't many superlatives left for Biles to pursue. But her combined 32 medals from the World Championships and Olympic Games are one medal short of Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus, who began his career under the old Soviet regime. Biles has a chance to surpass him this year — and she has also set her sights on a return to the Olympics, at the 2024 Paris Games.</p>
