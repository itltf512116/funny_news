   <p>Federal prosecutors say they will seek an indictment against Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden's son, relating to gun charges by the end of the month, according to  filed Wednesday.</p>   <p>The new development comes a month after U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland  in the investigation into the president's son, following a plea deal struck between Hunter Biden and federal prosecutors </p>

   <p>"The Speedy Trial Act requires that the Government obtain the return of an indictment by a grand jury by Friday, September 29, 2023, at the earliest. The Government intends to seek the return of an indictment in this case before that date," the filing states.</p>   <p>Specifics about the charges that Weiss will seek against Hunter Biden were not disclosed directly in the latest filing. </p>   <p>Attorneys for Hunter Biden did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment regarding the indictment.</p>   <p>In a  Wednesday, Hunter Biden's attorneys said he has continued to comply with the restrictions of the firearm diversion agreement — which required him to remain drug-free without committing additional crimes in order for his gun charge to be dismissed.</p>

   <p>Back in June, Hunter Biden  related to his taxes and business dealings.  Federal authorities also charged Biden with a felony firearm offense, in which he agreed to enter a pretrial diversion agreement that would allow him to avoid prosecution. </p>   <p>According to Weiss, Hunter Biden did not pay federal income taxes for either 2017 or 2018 despite owing more than $100,000 in taxes each year.</p>   <p></p>   <p class="contributors-text"></p>
