   <p>PARRIS ISLAND, S.C. – It's still pitch black and Marine recruits are scurrying around under garish spotlights, stacking their weapons and packs, all under the constant screams of drill instructors who loom over them.</p>   <p>Soon they're filing into a cavernous auditorium. A long, surging stream of shaved heads and green T-shirts. They take their seats and get ready for a history lesson with Staff Sgt. Mark Anthony Ross. </p>   <p>"By a show of hands, who was born after the September 11<sup>th</sup> attack ... most of us right?" Ross booms. "Do we know what happened during the 9/11 attacks? For those of us who may not know what happened, our country was under attack from the terrorists, make sense? They came within our borders and attacked us from the inside."</p>   
        


    
        
            <p>
                An exhibit dedicated to September 11th terrorist attacks is on display inside the Parris Island Museum at Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island on August 22 in Beaufort County, S.C.

   <h3 class="edTag">'An exercise of forgetting'</h3>   <p>For many Americans, 9/11 is now simply a date to mark, much like December 7th with the Pearl Harbor attacks. Even the military war colleges are moving on. The talk is not of 9/11 the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan and lessons learned, but China and new weapons needed.</p>   <p>Carter Malkasian, who chairs the defense analysis department at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., and wrote the book, said Sept. 11 isn't spoken about directly much, "though there is a fairly strong sense, even pride, that the armed forces protected America against terrorism after 9/11." </p>

   <p>"I called my recruiter and I said I want my date bumped up," she recalled. "Can I leave sooner? The recruiter was like, 'Are you sure you want to do this?' And I said, 'Yes I want to do this. Did you not see what happened on the news? I want to do this.' So he asked me how soon did I want to leave. And I was like, 'I'll leave tomorrow if you tell me.' "</p>   <p>She ended up with multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, fixing generators in local villages.</p>   <p>A few years later, 1st Sgt. Brian Dear joined up to fight too, eager to avenge 9/11. He served in both Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>   <p>"In recruit training that's all they pitched to us. Going to war, going to war, going to war," he recalled. "And that's what we all wanted. We're all talking about I can't wait to go to war, you know, I don't want this to ever happen to my country again."</p>

"He ran in and was helping people get out. And he was crushed by a support beam and it broke his legs. So it feels like it's still a recovery for my family.
