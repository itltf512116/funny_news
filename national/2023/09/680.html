   <p>Tropical Storm Ophelia has strengthened before making landfall on the coast of North Carolina early Saturday, pushing out near-hurricane force winds. The storm is forecast to bring high gusts, coastal flooding and life-threatening rip currents northward to New Jersey over the weekend.</p>   <p>The storm  near Emerald Isle, N.C., around 6:15 a.m. ET, with maximum winds of 70 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.</p>   <p>The center issued a hurricane watch from north of Surf City to Ocracoke Inlet in North Carolina, a roughly 130-mile stretch.</p>   <p>Forecasters said the storm is likely to weaken after landfall, the center said.</p>    in most of the U.S. because of more extreme precipitation and sea level rise from climate change. </p>   <p>The storm picked up speed as it was upgraded on Friday afternoon from a "Potential Tropical Cyclone 16," as the NHC terms it, to a tropical storm. As of Saturday at 2 a.m. ET, Ophelia was moving 12 mph while about 25 miles southeast of Cape Lookout in North Carolina. </p>   <p>As it continues plotting a northerly path, the NHC said the storm will move across eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and the Delmarva Peninsula on Saturday and Sunday. </p>   <p>A few tornadoes are possible Friday and Saturday in the mid-Atlantic states, the NHC said.</p>   <p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and the state's department of public safety  urged residents across eastern and central portions of the state to be prepared for tropical weather over the next couple of days. Warning of the potential for downed trees, power outages and flooding, the officials also encouraged people to stay tuned to the latest weather forecasts.</p>   <p>"As tropical weather is threatening our state again, we are reminded of the importance of being prepared by having a family emergency plan and kit," Gov. Cooper said in a statement Thursday. </p>   <p>North Carolina Emergency Management director Will Ray said the department is prepared to provide needed resources.</p>
