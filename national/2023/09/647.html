   <p>Anheuser-Busch says it will end the practice of amputating the tails of its signature Budweiser Clydesdale horses, following a pressure campaign from the animal rights group PETA.</p>   <p>The beer company said  the practice of equine tail docking was discontinued earlier this year, according to a statement from an Anheuser-Busch spokesperson. </p>   <p>PETA had earlier this year  criticizing the beermaker's practices, including  — a sharp rebuke to Budweiser's decades-spanning custom of running Super Bowl ads featuring the .</p>   <p>The animal rights organization posted video it said had been recorded at Warm Springs Ranch in Missouri, the official breeding facility for Budweiser's Clydesdales, and Grant's Farm, a Busch family property — both facilities that can be visited by the public. The video shows horses at the farms rapidly , apparently swatting away insects with limited success.</p>   . For public events, the tails on Budweiser Clydesdales are formed into buns and adorned with ribbons." </p>

                The practice known as tail docking artificially shortens a horse's tail. Budweiser says it has stopped the practice on its signature Clydesdales, seen here in 2012.

   <p>"Docking may be done either surgically or by ligature—placing rubber rings or other binders around the end of the tail to cause tissue to die," Kate Hepworth-Warren, assistant professor of veterinary medicine at North Carolina State University, writes in  "Surgical removal must be done by a licensed veterinarian in states where the procedure is legal. Pain relating to the procedure itself is not the primary welfare issue; instead the concern is the permanent disfigurement that leaves the horse unable to swat flies or use his tail to communicate."</p>   <p>Hepworth-Warren notes that the practice is banned or regulated in 11 U.S. states and many European countries. Among the countries , home to Budweiser's parent company AB InBev.</p>   <p>Docking is  by the American Veterinary Medical Association and the American Association of Equine Practitioners, asserting that when performed for cosmetic purposes, the procedure does not contribute to the health or welfare of the horse.</p>

   <p>A tail is indeed important for a horse's welfare, as it is its instrument for swatting away biting insects.</p>   <p>"In just one day, a horse can lose a cup of blood to biting insects such as mosquitoes," wrote David L. Hu, associate professor of mechanical engineering and biology at Georgia Institute of Technology, in a . "Not only do the mosquitoes take blood, but they also give disease. Malaria, Zika virus, dengue fever are just a few of them. Keeping even a fraction of the mosquitoes away could have a big impact on a horse's health."</p>    that the care and treatment for its Clydesdales and Dalmatians had been certified by American Humane. </p>   <p>The animal welfare organization said it has worked with the beer company on "identifying and completing improvements to add to the quality of care for the Budweiser Clydesdales and Dalmatians," including discontinuing the practice of equine tail docking.</p>
