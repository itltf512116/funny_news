   <p>Federal wildland firefighters were on the frontlines of some of the harshest wildfires to hit the U.S. and Canada this summer. But as Congress is inching towards its Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government, those firefighters stand to lose half their salaries. </p>   <p>And whether or not the government makes a deal, rent is due Oct. 1.</p>

   <p>Granberg's base wage is $37,000. Like many wildland firefighters, she relies on overtime hours to supplement the rest of her paycheck. The pay bump from the Infrastructure Law brought her up to almost $50,000.</p>   , which for over a decade have faced staffing shortages and low morale. In 2021, President Biden increased federal wildland firefighter wages to a $15 an-hour minimum. Still, some state outfits like the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) and the Unified Fire Authority in Utah will pay upwards of $50,000 base salary to someone even without experience.</p>   <p>The threat of a pay cliff has many worried staffing shortages could worsen in the coming year. Even with the supplemental wages, many reported staffing issues this year. DOI hired more than 87% of the goal for firefighters. The Forest Service said it hit 99% of its hiring target in July. </p>   <p>But the numbers don't always match the story on the ground.</p>

   <p>"I can tell you where I am at is not fully staffed," said Ben McLane, a wildland firefighter captain. He noted his current $70,000 salary will drop to $50,000 after the money runs out while someone at CalFire with his experience could make $120,000.</p>   <p> "There are engines parked that we can't take to wildfires because we don't have the amount of people to even minimally staff what we have on paper," he explained.</p>   <p>McLane, like others who spoke to NPR, reported fire truck engines and equipment not being used this year because the staff was not there to operate them. Others told NPR they have been moved around to account for shortages in other areas, and have also seen their own crews operate with limited personnel.</p>   , which would permanently increase base pay for federal firefighters.</p>   <p>But in the House, Republicans and Democrats have separate efforts. While some acknowledge that DOI will run out of money by the end of the month, others take issue with how the Forest Service has calculated when it is set to run out of money.</p>   <p>"We all are in agreement they need a long term solution but in the short term firefighters are saying they are going to quit in two weeks," said a Republican staffer familiar with negotiations, adding that the Forest Service recently calculated it would have money for two additional pay cycles instead. "A permanent solution is not mutually exclusive from transparency questions."</p>   <p>Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., introduced his own measure, which would keep the base pay increases from the infrastructure law but only for two more years.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, firefighters on the ground are still working and a pay cliff, they said, will eventually affect them.</p>   <aside id="ad-overflow-4-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>"There's just the uncertainty of what my income is going to be," said a wildland firefighter who asked to be kept anonymous because of a pending job offer could be withdrawn for publicly criticizes the legislation. They said they also stand to lose up to $20,000. "Even with the Paycheck Protection Act. We're still going to see a pay cut with that. But we don't even know if that's going to be passed. So I think it's kind of coming down to how much of a cut are we going to be seeing?"</p>
