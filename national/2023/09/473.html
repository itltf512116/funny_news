   <p>In similar fashion as seen in the , Harris says they threw him to the ground, dragged, stomped and beat him until residents came out of their apartments to see what was happening. Harris believes those witnesses saved his life.</p>   <p>He ended up in the hospital, and was arrested on what a judge later dismissed as trumped-up charges.

He says lawmakers have not gotten the answers they're looking for from police leadership.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">Not much transparency, not much candor</h3>   <p>"Not much transparency, not much candor as relates to the inner workings of our police department," Smiley says. "And that's problematic and troubling. Hopefully the Justice Department is able to get more information than we can."</p>   <p>The council has passed ordinances designed to prevent officers from making petty traffic stops, and to create an online portal that gives the public access to records of police misconduct.</p>   <p>It also approved a pay raise in an effort to address an ongoing struggle to recruit and retain officers. But the effect of those changes has yet to be seen.</p>

                The Rev. Earle Fisher says what's going on in Memphis should be viewed in context of the push for criminal justice reform across the country. "If you've been Black in America for 15 minutes, you know something about the trauma related to policing."

   <p>The , senior pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in the predominantly Black Whitehaven neighborhood, says what's going on in Memphis should be viewed in context of the push for criminal justice reform across the country.</p>   <p>"If you've been Black in America for 15 minutes, you know something about the trauma related to policing," Fisher says.</p>   <p>Fisher is part of a group of clergy who petitioned the Justice Department to conduct a pattern or practice investigation. He says the probe has the potential to validate and verify what activists have long complained about.</p>   <p>"Now, at least when these reports come out, they won't say that that's just that radical preacher in Whitehaven," he says. "No, the Department of Justice said this."</p>

   <p>Fisher and others are calling for more investment to address poverty in Memphis, and less contact and conflict between residents and police.</p>   <p>"Show some humanness," says local food truck operator Keedran Franklin, an organizer for the group Black Man Build.</p>   <p>He would like to see the police driven more by services than by analyzing crime data.</p>   <p>"Because if I look at data, I can I just look at data. But if I look at people, I can learn their story and I can be empathetic. I understand that not every scenario is the same."</p>   <p>Franklin says that not every Black man should be treated like a criminal just because they live in a community where Black men may have committed crimes.</p>

   <p>"That you can't keep doing this. Every time you do this, that it's going to hurt your pockets," says Wells. "Making it where these police officers are really held accountable that decided to beat my son to death."</p>   <p>"We're not taking this anymore. You fix your police department or you will be sued each and every time."</p>   <p>Wells says , and just like  in Minneapolis, she hopes her family's tragic loss can bring change.</p>
