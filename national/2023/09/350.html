   <p>Tens of thousands of attendees are stranded at the Burning Man music and arts festival after storms turned Nevada's Black Rock Desert playa into a mud bath.</p>   <p>Close to an inch of precipitation flooded the area starting on Friday, prompting event organizers to close access to the festival until vehicles could safely pass and to warn campers to conserve food and water. </p>   <p>Despite reports of stuck vehicles, overflowing port-a-potties, postponed bus pickups and spotty Wi-Fi service, several attendees who spoke to NPR say the wet weather hasn't dampened moods. </p>   <p>"We're pooling all our food as far as resources. And I would say honestly, walking around the city, spirits are pretty high," attendee Anya Kamenetz .</p>   .</p>   <p>Event volunteer Josh Lease said that in true Burning Man spirit, people are sharing warm clothes and phone chargers where they can — and music is blaring.</p>   <p>"It's like any other Burning Man, just muddy," he told NPR on Saturday evening.</p>

   <p>"The warnings do sound very dire, and of course, the organization has to tell people to take care," said , an editor with NPR's  who attended the event, but "I haven't seen one person who seems worried about it at all." </p>   <p>Some frustration, however, started to seep in for some attendees by Sunday.</p>   <p>In rainy Burning Mans past, longtime burner Joe Bamberg said he's seen couches, carpets and clothes eventually dry out. But this time, he said, "all is damp and will be ruined by mold," he said.</p>

   <p>"Make sure you have water and the strength to walk as much as 5 miles through the mud," the nonprofit said. "This isn't a simple solution, but it is a possible one should you need or want to make the trek."</p>   <p>Music producer Diplo said he and comedian Chris Rock escaped the event on Saturday after walking 6 miles before hitching a ride from a fan in a pickup truck.</p>   <p>"I legit walked the side of the road for hours with my thumb out cuz I have a show in dc tonight and didnt want to let yall down," .</p>   <p>Neal Katyal, former acting Obama-era solicitor general, also made the trek out. He  after his first trip to the festival ended with "an incredibly harrowing 6 mile hike at midnight through heavy and slippery mud."</p>   <p>President Biden has been briefed on the situation, according to a White House official, and the administration is monitoring the event. Event attendees should listen to state and local officials, and event organizers, the administration official said.</p>
