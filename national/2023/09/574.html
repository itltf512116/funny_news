   <p>For the second time in two weeks, Pennsylvania police scrambled to conduct a manhunt and local residents were set on edge after inmates broke out of detention facilities. </p>   <p>This time it was nine male teens who escaped from the Abraxas Academy in Morgantown on Sunday evening. Police said all nine were back in custody as of Monday morning. </p>   <p>The overnight search unfolded roughly 15 miles from where escaped inmate  was taken into custody last week after  and leading police on a two-week chase that captivated the nation. </p>

   <p>The teens worked together to overtake two female guards, steal keys to the facility, slip out of a side door and climb under a fence. </p>   <p>An estimated 60 authorities were called in for an overnight search conducted with drones and K-9 units, said State Police Trooper David Beohm.</p>   <p>Police quickly received a tip on the group's whereabouts after at least one of them broke into a car in an attempt to steal it, setting off the car's alarm and prompting the homeowner to call the police. </p>   <p>Four of the teens were taken into custody Monday morning at 5:47 a.m., roughly 4.5 miles from the detention center. Trooper Beohm said they knocked on a homeowner's door and turned themselves in. </p>

   <p>"They basically gave up because they were tired, they were cold," he said, adding that they had only slide shoes as footwear. "Those woods are a far cry from the streets of Harrisburg or Philly." </p>   <p>The remaining five were detained just down the road around 6:30 a.m. after police received a report of a stolen truck and trailer. </p>   <p>Once police spotted the vehicle, there was a "short pursuit" and one of the boys was apprehended after taking off on foot, Beohm said. </p>   . </p>   <p>The center, which first opened in 1973, describes itself as a "safe and trauma-informed treatment environment" for at-risk youth, providing services to over 7,000 youth and their families each year. </p>
