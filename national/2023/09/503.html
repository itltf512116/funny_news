   <p>A top adviser to President Joe Biden, whose prominent communications firm helped launch a high-profile effort to assist victims of sexual harassment, rape and assault, was also a paid adviser to a powerful Illinois politician while he was being sued by one of those victims. </p>   <p>Anita Dunn, co-founder of the communications firm SKDK and widely considered a member of the president's inner circle, provided "crisis communications" assistance to Michael Madigan, the then-Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, from 2018 to 2019. That work netted Dunn and her firm more than $200,000, according to campaign finance disclosures. </p>   <p>Madigan, who was also the leader of the state Democratic Party at the time, was not personally accused of sexual misconduct, but was being sued by a former employee of his political committees. That former employee, Alaina Hampton,  that Madigan retaliated against her when she reported that her direct supervisor had repeatedly harassed her over text messages.</p>    last month — part of a  federal corruption investigation into Madigan — in which two of Madigan's top aides were caught on an FBI  briefly discussing Dunn's "crisis communications" work for them. </p>   <p>One of the two men recorded on the wiretap, both of whom are now  , even spelled out her name, "D-U-N-N." An  discussing Dunn and SKDK's work for Madigan was also entered into evidence. Prosecutors never implicated Dunn or SKDK in any of the alleged wrongdoing by Madigan or his allies. Chicago Public Media and the  covered the trial extensively, and shared the evidence with NPR.</p>   <p>"To learn that [Dunn] was helping advise my former employer on my retaliation case due to sexual harassment is just a clear conflict of interest, and I think anyone can see that for what it is," said Hampton. "It's really a violation of trust and it feels like a betrayal."</p>   <p>Uma M. Iyer, a spokesperson for the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, said in a statement: "We were surprised to learn from press coverage that Speaker Madigan retained SKDK – we had no prior knowledge of this fact and can imagine how a revelation like this is deeply upsetting to Ms. Hampton. As a team made up of survivors and individuals who fight for justice every day, we share her frustration."</p>    on SKDK's website, Barkoff Lamy led SKDK's work with the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund during the time of Hampton's case. </p>

   <p>Over her decades-long career, Dunn has been called a  for women in the world of politics. She served as communications director in Barack Obama's White House, helped lead the Biden campaign to victory in 2020 and has touted the fact that the Biden administration has placed many women in senior roles. In an  with C-SPAN early on in the Biden administration, Dunn said "This is a White House where we could say women rule." Still, this is not the first time Dunn's connections to men accused of harassment have raised questions.</p>    and the  published investigations into pervasive allegations of sexual misconduct and assault by Weinstein, . At the time, SKDK released a  saying that Dunn had spoken to Weinstein at the request of an unnamed friend and SKDK had no relationship with Weinstein. The statement added somewhat cryptically, "If you know Anita, you can only imagine what she said to him." NPR asked SKDK specifically about what Dunn told Weinstein. The firm did not respond. Weinstein is currently serving a prison sentence in New York following convictions in both  and  for rape and sexual assault.</p>   <p>In 2019, Dunn also  for giving an interview to the journalist Mark Halperin for a planned book titled . Two years prior, Halperin had faced  of workplace sexual harassment. When Dunn's participation in Halperin's book became known, an SKDK spokesperson told CNN, "Anita cares about beating Donald Trump, that is the only reason she participated."</p>   <p>Dunn is also no stranger to  around her business, particularly regarding how she manages her current role in the White House given her lucrative past consulting work for big corporations like AT&T and Pfizer.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">How a #MeToo story, an Illinois power broker and a top White House adviser connect</h3>   <p>At the beginning of 2018, SKDK began its  with the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund. </p>   <p>In the wake of allegations first against Harvey Weinstein, then many others, the fund was established in order to support survivors of sexual harassment, abuse and assault, and helped fund some survivors' legal fees. </p>   <p>The National Women's Law Center administered the fund and the legal side of Time's Up, but turned to SKDK for additional help for women dealing with media attention about their stories of assault and harassment. </p>    "storytelling and media relations support." That work often involved connecting harassment survivors with public relations professionals, who would generally work at a reduced rate. Many of those PR professionals were not SKDK employees, and they were paid by the National Women's Law Center. </p>   <p>SKDK boasted about the partnership,  on social media that it was "proud to partner with @TIMESUPNOW #TimesUpLegalDefenseFund #TimesUp." </p>   <p>Around that same time, a #MeToo era sexual harassment scandal began dominating Illinois politics and challenged the political future of Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, the longest-serving leader of any state house in American history.</p>   <p>Alaina Hampton grew up in Illinois and, in her own telling, began working on political campaigns with a lot more idealism about politics than she has now. Her experience working on campaigns for Madigan's political committees changed her outlook. </p>   <p>In Feb. 2018, Hampton went public with accusations that she was harassed over text messages for months by a direct supervisor in her work for one of those political committees, called Friends of Madigan. </p>   <p>She reported the harassment to multiple people, including Madigan himself, Hampton alleged in a . Though Hampton's supervisor was eventually , Hampton alleged that her report of harassment was initially ignored or minimized. Then, she said, came retaliation in the form of blacklisting her from jobs on other political campaigns. She filed her lawsuit against multiple campaign committees associated with Madigan, including Friends of Madigan. </p>   <p>Though Madigan was never personally accused of sexual harassment, after Hampton went public, more women raised  of inappropriate workplace behavior by other men who worked for Madigan, and said that their concerns were largely ignored. Madigan denied wrongdoing.</p>   <p>Behind the scenes, according to emails later released at the perjury trial of Madigan's longtime chief of staff, Timothy Mapes, Madigan's allies worried that the scandal could loosen his grip on power.</p>   ," to Mapes in Feb. 2018. </p>   <p>"In June [2018], it became clear that 'we' did not know how to handle this problem nor did we have a 'plan' to be assertive," McClain again  to Mapes later that year. They started interviewing multiple crisis management firms.</p>   <p>"We landed on SKDKnickerbocker. [T]he lead is Anita Dunn. She met with us and the Speaker and laid out a plan," McClain wrote to Mapes. "The S liked it and he hired her." (Court records show that McClain sometimes referred to House Speaker Madigan as "The S.") </p>

   <p>Illinois campaign finance records  that Friends of Madigan paid SKDK $37,500 for "media consulting" on Aug. 30, 2018, though those records were not disclosed until that October. </p>   <p>A few weeks after that payment, as part of the plan apparently recommended by Dunn and SKDK, an op-ed by Madigan appeared in the , in which Madigan said he was taking on workplace harassment in the Illinois state Capitol. </p>   <p>"I have made it a personal mission to take this issue head-on and correct past mistakes," he wrote in the op-ed. "I wish I would have done so sooner." </p>   <p>In response to NPR's questions about SKDK's work for Madigan at the time, SKDK's initial statement said, "As a matter of firm policy, we do not help sexual harassment abusers. We work for survivors and for systemic change to combat harassment-filled workplaces. In this case, Anita agreed to help Speaker Madigan take accountability in a very public way so he could start to fix his workplace."</p>   <p>Meanwhile, Hampton's case was constantly generating headlines. </p>   <p>To help manage media requests, Hampton turned to Joanna Klonsky, a Chicago-based political consultant. Klonsky also helped Hampton connect with Time's Up and one of its founders, Tina Tchen, and shared information about the case with SKDK beginning around August 2018.</p>    that Hampton had been subjected to a hostile work environment, and the man she accused of harassment issued an . </p>   <p>"No one deserves to be retaliated against for reporting sexual misconduct in their workplace," the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund  on social media that it was "proud to support Alaina Hampton in this case."</p>   <p>In the statement to NPR earlier this week, SKDK's spokesperson said, "We empathize with the survivor of Madigan's aide and we're glad she got to settle her case."</p>   <p>In the end, a federal corruption investigation proved to be an even greater threat to Madigan's power than the sexual harassment case. In 2021, he lost his position in the Illinois House of Representatives, resigned under pressure and the following year he was indicted on bribery and racketeering charges. Madigan has denied all wrongdoing and is set to go to trial in 2024. </p>   <h3 class="edTag">An echo of broader problems for Time's Up</h3>   <p>The concerns about conflict of interest involving SKDK, Time's Up and Madigan in many ways echo a series of revelations that followed the sexual harassment scandal that forced former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo out of office.</p>   <p>In 2021, New York's attorney general released a report finding that Cuomo had sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo denied wrongdoing. The report also  that prominent figures with Time's Up had assisted with Cuomo's response to the allegations. One of SKDK's partners at the time, a co-founder of Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, was also involved in discussions on how to assist Cuomo's response. The leader of Human Rights Campaign, an influential LGBTQ+ rights group, also lost his position based on  that he helped the Cuomo team respond to the allegations.</p>

   <p>Time's Up Now<strong> </strong>subsequently went through what the organization called a "major reset," before eventually  earlier this year. </p>   <p>The National Women's Law Center still administers the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, but it severed its relationship with SKDK, in part because of conflict of interest concerns stemming from the Cuomo revelations. </p>   <p>"In December 2021, the TIME'S UP Legal Defense Fund ended this contract with SKDK and moved the function of connecting survivors with public relations professionals in-house, in part to ensure that there are no potential perceived or actual conflicts while doing this work – and that survivors' needs and safety are always prioritized," said Iyer, who is both a spokesperson for Time's Up Legal Defense Fund and the National Women's Law Center.</p>   <aside id="ad-overflow-8-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>Both the Cuomo and Madigan revelations have caused Hampton to reconsider her view of the organization she once viewed as a lifeline, and a woman working at the top of presidential politics.</p>   <p>NPR asked Hampton what she would say to Anita Dunn given what she learned about her representation of Michael Madigan.</p>   <p>"I don't know Anita Dunn, and I hope I never will," Hampton said. "But I would question her on her values and integrity, and I would ask her how she can credibly claim her commitment to women's rights and issues."</p>   <p>Hampton said she doesn't believe SKDK's apology does "enough to repair the damage they did." She told NPR that what worries her most is the possibility that victims of harassment and abuse will look at her experience with SKDK and think twice before coming forward. </p>
