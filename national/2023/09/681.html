   <p>A Black high school student in Texas was suspended for more than two weeks for wearing a natural hairstyle that school officials say violated the district's dress code. </p>   <p>Now, he and his mother are suing Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the state's attorney general for allegedly failing to enforce a state law that prohibits hair discrimination. </p>   <p>Darryl George, a junior at Barbers Hill High School in Mont Belvieu, (a town roughly 40 minutes outside of Houston) has faced numerous in-school suspensions since Aug. 31 due to his locs. School officials say George's locs fell below his eyebrows and ear lobes, , which  for male students. </p>    went statewide on Sept 1.</p>   <p>"He has to sit on a stool for eight hours in a cubicle," Darryl's mother, Darresha George, told . "That's very uncomfortable. Every day he'd come home, he'd say his back hurts because he has to sit on a stool."</p>   <p>Plaintiffs Darryl and Darresha George are seeking an injunction and a temporary restraining order against Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton to compel them to stop the district from "exposing their students to disciplinary punishment and disciplinary measures due to locs, braid, twists and other protective styles that are alleged to be or that are longer than the District or schools' length requirement."</p>   <p>The filing comes after the school asked a court to clarify whether the new law "prohibits grooming policies addressing the length of a male student's hair."</p>   <p>The student's suspension continues to generate questions about the legality of punishing students<strong> </strong>for their hair and the extent of the newly passed law's protections.</p>

                In Minnesota, the CROWN Act, an acronym meaning "Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair," adds hairstyle and texture to a provision in the Minnesota Human Rights Act that prohibits racial discrimination in housing, employment and education, among other areas. Here, Rep. Esther Agbaje, D-Minneapolis, speaks to reporters outside of the House chamber in St. Paul on Feb. 28, 2022.

   <p>The CROWN Act refers to laws that ban discrimination on the basis of hair texture or protective hairstyles associated with race. </p>   <p>First introduced  in 2019, the act, in part, bans discrimination against hairstyles that are often associated with race — which can prevent employers, educators and others from imposing strict rules related to one's physical appearance.</p>   <p>The inaugural CROWN Act expanded the definition when it comes to race in California's  and the state's Education Code — aiming for protection across workplaces in addition to K-12 public and charter schools, according to  for the campaign to pass the legislation.</p>
