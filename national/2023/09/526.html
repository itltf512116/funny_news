   <p>To kick off Hispanic Heritage Month, Google is celebrating Luisa Moreno, a Guatemalan-American journalist turned labor organizer who united and mobilized Spanish-speaking communities in the U.S. around worker's rights nearly a century ago.</p>   <p>Friday's Google Doodle depicts Moreno holding a megaphone and linking arms with a group of people. The artist behind the illustration, Juliet Menéndez, who is also Guatemalan-American, told NPR she wanted to represent Moreno's work in rallying people of different races and classes. </p>   <p>"As an immigrant, she came in and brought so many people in the United States together," Menéndez said. "She did a lot to bring the Latinx community together, at a time when it wasn't defined as such."</p>

   <h3 class="edTag">Moreno advocated for tobacco and food industry workers</h3>   <p>Born in Guatemala in the early 1900s (variously reported as 1906 0r 1907), Moreno began organizing as a teenager after learning that women in her country were not allowed to attend university. She protested and lobbied for women to have greater access to higher education. Eventually, the campaign was successful, according to . </p>   <p>After a brief stint in journalism, Moreno, still in her 20s, moved to New York City. Incidents of police brutality against Latino protesters there, as well as poor working conditions in garment factories, spurred her return to activism.</p>   <p>In 1935, she became a professional organizer with the American Federation of Labor and advocated for workers across the country, particularly in the food and tobacco industries. Six years later, Moreno was elected vice president of the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing and Allied Workers of America. </p>   .</p>   <p>Forced to leave the U.S., Moreno returned to Latin America in 1950, where she continued to organize in Mexico, Cuba and Guatemala. She died in 1992.</p>
