   <p>This Labor Day weekend is shaping up to be a crowded one, from airports to interstates. </p>   <p>The Federal Aviation Administration predicts this will be the  of the year so far, behind the weekends of Juneteenth (which overlapped with Father's Day) and Presidents Day in February. </p>   <p>It's forecasting a peak of 52,000 flights on Thursday, compared to its  of 45,000. </p>

It projects there will be more than 2.7 million passengers on Friday, its busiest day. </p>   <p>And AAA expects to see  than it has in years, especially on Friday and Monday afternoons. It says Labor Day weekend bookings of flights, hotels, rental cars and cruises are up 4% domestically and 44% internationally over last Labor Day. </p>

   <p>And it's not just the sheer number of travelers that could create a hassle. </p>   <p>Parts of the South are still recovering from Hurricane Idalia, which  several Florida airports and disrupted thousands of flights earlier this week. Plus, American Airlines flight attendants voted to  on Wednesday, while   and  picketed outside airports across the country on Thursday. </p>   <p>David Koenig, airlines reporter for the Associated Press, is cautiously optimistic. He says the flight attendants aren't likely to actually call a strike anytime soon — in part because federal law makes it so hard for airline unions to do so — and air travel seems to have recovered from the impacts of Idalia.</p>

   <p>"It's important that drivers remember that their vehicle can break down just as easily over Labor Day weekend as it can at any time of year and that they take every precaution to ensure that their cars are road ready," says Amy Parmenter, spokesperson for AAA in Greater Hartford. </p>   <p>They advise checking tire pressure and tread, making sure your battery is in good condition, checking your air conditioning, windshield wipers, fluids and headlight functionality and fully charging your cell phone before driving. </p>   <p>AAA also recommends stocking your car with a summer emergency kit, including jumper cables, tools, first aid supplies, a flashlight, road flare or reflective triangle, extra medications, water and snacks.  </p>   <p></p>
