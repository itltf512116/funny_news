   <p>Maia the dog was found exhausted but in good health on Saturday after three weeks of evading capture at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport — the busiest in the world. She had escaped from her crate while it was being loaded onto a flight from Atlanta to the Dominican Republic.</p>   <p>Paula Rodriguez was traveling from her home in the Dominican Republic to San Francisco for a vacation on Aug. 18 when things took a turn for the worse. Her visa was canceled, , and she had to spend the night in a detention center before a return flight home the following day. </p>    page started by Rodriguez's sister, Maia and her owner had been inseparable for almost seven years, "which is probably why Maia so desperately broke through her kennel bag when they were separated," the page reads. "Maia needed to get back to Paula, especially after a very stressful travel."</p>   <p>Robin Allgood, who is known as a volunteer animal recovery specialist, created a  at the end of August to help reunite Rodriguez with her beloved pet. She also posted signs for the lost dog, which paid off when a call came in at 2:30 a.m. on Saturday from a FedEx cargo worker who had spotted Maia.</p>   </p>&mdash; Atlanta Airport (@ATLairport) </blockquote>

   <p>The Atlanta airport shared the good news over X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday morning. </p>   <p>Maia and Rodriguez were finally reunited on Sunday and have since returned home to the Dominican Republic, Allgood posted on Facebook.</p>   <p>According to the Department of Transportation's , more than 188,000 animals were transported by airlines in 2022, during which time seven animals died and one was lost. And although incidents like Maia's are rare, they often make headlines.</p>   <p>A Bengal cat named Breezy escaped from her carrier at Denver International Airport in mid-August and spent several days roaming the airport grounds before she was caught and returned to her owner, NBC 9 News .</p>   <p>NPR  that a 4-year-old cat named Rowdy went missing in Boston's Logan International Airport in late June 2022. Rowdy got loose from her carrier after flying in from Frankfurt, Germany. Airport staff, animal shelter volunteers and construction workers spent three weeks trying to catch the cat before she was successfully apprehended.</p>   , and was eventually found hiding in bushes outside the airport.</p>
