   <p>Heavy rains and thick mud stranded thousands at this year's Burning Man music and arts festival in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. But some who were caught in the mix said learning to roll with the mayhem is part of the experience. </p>   <p>Festival organizers lifted a driving ban on Monday afternoon as muddy roads that had stranded thousands of attendees in the Nevada desert had dried up enough to allow people to begin leaving. </p>   <p>"Exodus operations have officially begun in Black Rock City,"  Monday at 2 p.m. local time, about seven hours before the festival's fiery conclusion. The torching of a giant, faceless, man-shaped effigy was carried out Monday evening, after having been postponed twice due to the weather. </p>   </p>

   <p>And that was just the beginning of the journey home for the roughly 72,000 attendees who traveled to the festival's remote site in northern Nevada, about 120 miles north of the nearest airport in Reno.  that it did not have the facilities to house travelers for long periods of time while they sorted out plans. </p>   <p>"It is business as usual here, as we planned for a busy holiday/Burning Man weekend," a spokesperson for the airport, Stacey Sunday, told NPR over email. "We are providing booties and a wash station for Burning Man attendees." </p>   <p>Even during normal years, exodus, according to the organizers. Cars, trucks and RVs stuffed with sleeping bags, stoves and tents all cram onto a single two-lane road leading to the nearest major highway. </p>    say the wet weather hadn't dampened moods.</p>   <p>"We're pooling all our food as far as resources. And I would say honestly, walking around the city, spirits are pretty high," attendee Anya Kamenetz .</p>

   <p>The challenging conditions are testing a community of so-called burners, which touts self-reliance and communal effort among its .</p>   <p>Event volunteer Josh Lease said that in true Burning Man spirit, people were sharing warm clothes and phone chargers where they could — and they kept the music blaring.</p>   <p>"It's like any other Burning Man, just muddy," he told NPR on Saturday evening.</p>   <p>"The warnings do sound very dire, and of course, the organization has to tell people to take care," said , an editor with NPR's  who attended the event, but "I haven't seen one person who seems worried about it at all."</p>   <p>This was the third burn for 29-year-old Maggie Liu, who said she and her two friends were fortunate to be in an RV when the weather rolled in. Liu had brought plenty of supplies in an effort to be prepared for anything, but this year's festival highlighted what was missing from her kit.</p>   <p>"One of our friends brought a pair of galoshes, and he was totally fine," Liu said. "Whereas I didn't prepare as well, and I only brought like the platform, burner boots that absolutely got wrecked in the mud and everything fell apart."</p>   </h3>

   <p>Some frustration, however, started to seep in for some attendees by Sunday.</p>   <p>In rainy Burning Mans past, longtime burner Joe Bamberg said he's seen couches, carpets and clothes eventually dry out. But this time, he said, "all is damp and will be ruined by mold," he said. </p>   <p> "I am not thrilled," said Bamberg, who added: "People make do, it is part of the adventure." </p>   <p>Meanwhile, authorities in Nevada were investigating a death at the site. The Pershing County sheriff said on Saturday that a person was found dead on the playa but declined to offer any further details  on Monday.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">Some burners made the trek out on foot</h3>

   <p>President Biden had been briefed on the situation, according to a White House official. Event attendees were told over the weekend to listen to state and local officials, and event organizers, the administration official said.</p>   <p>"We have come here knowing this is a place where we bring everything we need to survive," the organization said in a statement Saturday night. "It is because of this that we are all well-prepared for a weather event like this." </p>   <p>"We have done table-top drills for events like this. We are engaged full-time on all aspects of safety and looking ahead to our Exodus as our next priority."</p>    started at $575. </p>   <p>The weekend's events weren't the first time the entrance had been blocked at this year's festival.
