   <p>If you've ever felt hangry, consider this: Brown bears in Alaska woke up this spring after not eating for about 6 months. And no, "hangry" might not be a technical term. But in this case, it's apt.</p>   <p>"That's the term I use," media ranger Naomi Boak of  told NPR, speaking from Alaska.</p>   <p>But ever since the sockeye salmon run began on the Brooks River this summer, the bears have been feasting — and ballooning in size. That means it's time for , when fans of famous behemoths like Otis, Holly and 747 will vote for the plumpest bear in the land.</p>   , always impress.  also offers bios, with details about the large animals' equally large personalities.</p>

   <p>Two sisters and mothers, Bears 910 and 909, could make a big splash, Boak says. In a striking development, 910 is taking care of both bears' cubs, after , 909 Jr.</p>   <p>Then there's bear 164, whom the park rangers deem one of the most innovative bears. His fans know him as "Bucky Dent," because of his unique forehead.</p>   <p>"He is fishing where no other bear has dared to fish: right under the lip of the falls in front of what we call 'the jacuzzi,' which is where the most dominant bears like to fish," Boak said.</p>

   <p>"As heavy as possible," Boak said.</p>   <p>"We have some of the largest bears on the planet," she added. "The big boars, the biggest guys, can get to be between 1,000 and 1,400 pounds."</p>   <p>Sows, or female bears can reach 700 or 800 pounds, she said. For the bears to enter hibernation safely, Boak said, "they need every ounce of fat they can get."</p>

   <p>"The Bristol Bay ecosystem and watershed is really one of the last remaining healthy sockeye salmon runs in the world," Boak said, "and it's just gotten healthier and healthier."</p>   <p>The thriving ecosystem has helped bears reach maturity earlier. And this season has seen something of a baby boom.</p>   <p>"We had 36 cubs arrive here this year," Boak said. For context, she said that in a normal season, the area would likely see a total of around 100 bears.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">How old are the bears?</h3>   <p>Fat Bear Week contestants encompass a wide range.</p>    contest precedes Fat Bear Week, giving cubs a chance to strut their stuff.</p>   <p>Among the adult bears, there's Sara, who is in her early 30s.

   <p>The , turning back a challenge from the female 901 — a young upstart whom the park described as "both exploratory and occasionally mischievous."</p>   <p>Fat Bear contestants are, of course, blissfully oblivious to the millions of people who watch and support them.</p>   <p>But it seems that the competition isn't immune to our times: A key semifinal vote was recalibrated last fall, after organizers uncovered "spam votes" that were meant to send the blond-eared Holly sailing past 747 into the final.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">Is winter really coming?</h3>   <p>The autumnal equinox (on Sept. 22 or Sept. 23 in the U.S., ) signals shorter days and the looming winter. Fat Bear Week normally starts a week or two later.</p>   <p>"We don't know exactly what triggers the bears for hibernation," Boak said.</p>   <p>Not all bears follow the same schedule. On the Brooks River, most of the bears go into hibernation in late October or early November. They emerge again in March or April, skinny and, yes, hangry.</p>
