   <p>A painting from the very first episode of Bob Ross's "The Joy of Painting" could be yours, but not for cheap.</p>   <p>Titled , the piece is listed at $9.85 million and could be the most expensive and historically resonant Ross piece to ever be sold.</p>   <p>The work depicts a meandering stone path, a cerulean pond and a handful of luminescent trees — all elements that were painted in under 30 minutes during the premiere of what would become the hit PBS show. </p>   <p>The following 31 seasons (403 episodes) of the propelled Ross into one of the most recognizable faces in the 20th century art world, not to mention a pop culture icon known for his upbeat attitude and hokey aphorisms. </p>

   <p>Before he even picks up a paintbrush in episode one, Ross lays out what the audience can expect from the show: simple step-by-step instructions rendered with just a few basic tools and the same paint colors from week to week. </p>   <p>"There's no secret to this. Anyone can paint," he says later on, dabbing at the canvas in a shape that will later clarify into a tree. "All you need is a dream in your heart and a little practice." </p>

   <p>The painting is signed "Ross" in red on the lower left corner. Whoever buys the painting will receive a written statement from its original owner — a PBS volunteer who bought the painting at a benefit auction. </p>   <p>"I don't know the exact number that she paid at that point, but knowing what others paid around the same period, I'd assume it was somewhere under $100," says Ryan Nelson, the owner of Modern Artifact gallery in Minneapolis. </p>   <p>Nelson, whose gallery has become the primary facilitator of the growing Ross market, said he purchased the painting from the PBS volunteer with the intention of selling it, but now isn't so sure he's ready to let it go. </p>

   <p>"I think that the greatest thing we can do with it is travel it. I'd rather we get this in front of the public," he said. "But there are definitely offers that I would probably have to take." </p>   <p>He's confident he'll get his asking price, even if most Ross paintings that he's traded don't even break the six-figure range. </p>   <p>Part of his confidence is that Ross has made a recent cultural resurgence as younger generations discover his appeal through the internet. </p>   and attracted some 5.6 million viewers. </p>

Some internet aficionados say that Ross didn't want his paintings available for sale because it would've detracted from the joy he derived from his work. Nelson doesn't buy that theory. </p>   <p>"He sold them at malls, he gave them away at paintings lessons and so there are a lot of paintings that went out there," he said. "I believe, sadly, that a lot of those paintings didn't make it to the popularity that Ross is today." </p>   <p>But in a way, that's also how Ross would've wanted it, Nelson said. He wasn't interested in giving his art to well-to-do collector types or seeking fortune alongside his fame. </p>   <aside id="ad-third-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">
