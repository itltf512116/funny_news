"That's very uncomfortable. Every day he'd come home, he'd say his back hurts because he has to sit on a stool."</p>   <p>School officials say George's locs fell below his eyebrows and ear lobes, which , and the district is  whether the new law "prohibits grooming policies addressing the length of a male student's hair."</p>   <p>The student's suspension continues to generate questions about the legality of punishing students<strong> </strong>for their hair and the extent of the newly passed law's protections.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">What is the CROWN Act?</h3>

                The CROWN Act, an acronym meaning "Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair," would add hairstyle and texture to a provision in the Minnesota Human Rights Act that prohibits racial discrimination in housing, employment and education, among other areas. Here, Rep. Esther Agbaje, D-Minneapolis, speaks to reporters outside of the House chamber in St. Paul on Feb. 28, 2022.

   <p>The CROWN Act is a law that bans discrimination on the basis of hair texture or protective hairstyles associated with race. </p>   <p>First introduced  in 2019, the act, in part, works to criminalize the targeting of hairstyles that are often associated with race — which can prevent employers, educators and others from imposing strict rules related to one's physical appearance.</p>   <p>The inaugural CROWN Act expanded the definition when it comes to race in California's  and the state's Education Code — aiming for protection across workplaces in addition to K-12 public and charter schools, according to  for the campaign to pass the legislation.</p>

   <p>"Hair discrimination is rooted in systemic racism, and its purpose is to preserve white spaces," </p>   <p>"Policies that prohibit natural hairstyles, like afros, braids, bantu knots, and locs, have been used to justify the removal of Black children from classrooms, and Black adults from their employment," the organization added.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">How many states have passed the CROWN Act?</h3>   <p>So far, 24 states along with the U.S. Virgin Islands have : Alaska; Arizona; Arkansas; California; Colorado; Connecticut; Delaware; Illinois; Louisiana; Maine; Maryland; Massachusetts; Michigan; Minnesota; Nebraska; Nevada; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; Oregon; Tennessee; Texas; Virginia; and Washington.</p>   , which went into effect on Sept. 1.</p>

Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., who sponsored the legislation in the House, said  on the issue.</p>   <p>"Our fight is far from over. ... I am disappointed, but not defeated. I remain steadfast in my commitment to protecting all Americans' right to exist as their authentic selves," she added.</p>
