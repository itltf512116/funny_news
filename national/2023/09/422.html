                Hurricane Lee formed a well-defined eye wall on Thursday. The storm is seen here in a satellite image from around noon ET Thursday, showing the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico to the west.

   <h3 class="edTag">Lee is forecast to intensify at "remarkable rates"</h3>   <p>The hurricane center has repeatedly warned that Lee could become very powerful in an exceptionally short time. That guidance has now become even more dire, as the NHC said many forecasting tools "are calling for remarkable rates of intensification, beyond rates normally seen with model forecasts."</p>   <p>The main question right now, the NHC says, is "how strong Lee will get, and how quickly will it get there."</p>
