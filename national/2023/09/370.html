   <p>Schools and businesses have temporarily shut down after a convicted murderer escaped from a Pennsylvania prison and was seen on the run in the area. </p>   <p>Danelo Cavalcante, 34, escaped from the Chester County Prison, about 30 miles from Philadelphia, last Thursday and has since been spotted six times. He was last seen on a trail camera with a duffel bag and a hoodie at Longwood Gardens, about three miles away from the prison, on Monday night at 8:21 p.m. and again at 9:33 p.m., Pennsylvania State Police said. </p>   <p>Early Tuesday morning, Longwood Gardens alerted police of the footage. Police confirmed it was Cavalcante, and Longwood Gardens closed its facilities Tuesday and Wednesday, the Chester County District Attorney said. </p>   </h3>

   <p>"We squeezed him hard enough over the period of a few days, and he was not able to get any relief, and managed to find a place to get out," Bivens said. "Obviously, I wish we would have been able to capture him without him getting through that perimeter, but it is also not shocking. It's dark, it's a large area and not to make excuses – it's just difficult terrain."</p>   <p>The investigation into how Cavalcante escaped the Chester County Prison is ongoing, George Bivens, the deputy commissioner of operations for the Pennsylvania State Police, said at a Tuesday press conference.</p>

   <p>The district attorney's office said hundreds of law enforcement officers have been dispatched to help locate Cavalcante, using drones, helicopters and K-9s. It advised people in the area to lock their doors and monitor their cars and other surroundings. </p>   <p>Bivens said law enforcement have received about 100 tip calls on Cavalcante's whereabouts. </p>   <p>Cavalcante was sentenced to life in prison last month for killing his ex-girlfriend, according to The Associated Press. </p>   <p>There is a federal warrant out for Cavalcante's arrest. Pennsylvania State Police are offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. </p>
