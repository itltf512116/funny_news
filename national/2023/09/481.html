   <p><strong>What's the big deal?</strong></p>   <ul class="edTag">   <li>The Jets have not won or played in a Super Bowl since 1969. And Rosenblatt says the "curse" is attributed to the end of Joe Namath's run with the team.</li>   <li>Namath led the Jets to their single Super Bowl victory, but since he left in 1977, the Jets have only made the playoffs 12 times.</li>   <li>"So Aaron Rodgers kind of represented what [fans] have been seeking for so long, really since they traded for Brett Favre back in 2008, and even that didn't work out," Rossenblatt said. "So he's kind of represented hope that this fan base hasn't really had in a long time."</li>   <li>It's not just the constant hoping. The kind of season-ending injury that is threatening Rodgers has happened to multiple Jets quarterbacks:</li>   </ul>   <ol class="edTag">   <li>In 1999, Vinny Testaverde tore his Achilles tendon and was out.</li>   <li>In 2005, a shoulder injury brought starting quarterback Chad Pennington down.</li>   <li>Then — in that in 2005 — backup quarterback Jay Fiedler also went down with a season-ending shoulder injury.</li>   <li>In 2008, the Jets came close to joining the playoffs, but Favre's torn bicep hindered his performance. , his career improved.</li>   </ol>   <strong>.</strong></p>   <hr>   <p><strong>What are fans saying? </strong>They are going through the various stages of grief.</p>   <p>There was the hype, followed by the dismay:</p>   
            <blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@espn/video/7277758313255783722" data-video-id="7277758313255783722" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section>  Greeny’s reaction to the Aaron Rodgers injury 😭 (via stacygsg&#47;X, nikkigreeny&#47;X)       </section> </blockquote>

   <ul class="edTag">   <li>Rosenblatt says some of the problem is on the people at the top of the organization: "A lot of it is, you know, mismanagement, bad coaching or bad roster building. But this was the first time everybody felt pretty good about the roster that was built on the coaching staff in place. And then this happened."</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p>   <ul class="edTag">   <li></li>   <li></li>   <li></li>   </ul>
