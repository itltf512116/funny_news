   <p>Historically, most grand prize winners have opted to receive the prize as a one-time, lump sum payment, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.</p>   <p>Sometimes, winners do opt for the annuity, including the jackpot winner in Virginia from the March 4, 2023 drawing. That winner, whose name remains anonymous under Virginia law, chose an annuity worth $156.7 million to be paid out annually.</p>   <p>Before that, the last time a Powerball winner opted for the annuity was in 2014.</p>   <p>Mega Millions is played in 45 states as well as Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
