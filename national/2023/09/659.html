   <p>Tropical storm Ophelia has strengthened ahead of its expected arrival on the coast of North Carolina on Friday night, pushing out near-hurricane force winds. The storm is forecast to bring high gusts, coastal flooding and life-threatening rip currents northward to New Jersey over the weekend.</p>   <p>After the storm's maximum sustained winds increased to almost 70 mph with higher gusts, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch from north of Surf City to Ocracoke Inlet in North Carolina.</p>   <p>The bright side: Little change in strength is forecast before the storm's landfall through the rest of the weekend.</p>    in most of the U.S. because of more extreme precipitation and sea level rise from climate change. </p>

   <p>The storm picked up speed as it was upgraded on Friday afternoon from a "Potential Tropical Cyclone 16," as the NHC terms it, to a tropical storm. As of Friday evening, Ophelia was moving 13 mph while about 120 miles southeast of Cape Fear. </p>   <p>As it continues plotting a northerly path, the NHC said the storm will move across eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and the Delmarva Peninsula on Saturday and Sunday. </p>   <p>A few tornadoes are possible Friday and Saturday in the mid-Atlantic states, the NHC said.</p>   <p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and the state's department of public safety  urged residents across eastern and central portions of the state to be prepared for tropical weather over the next couple of days. Warning of the potential for downed trees, power outages and flooding, the officials also encouraged people to stay tuned to the latest weather forecasts.</p>   <p>"As tropical weather is threatening our state again, we are reminded of the importance of being prepared by having a family emergency plan and kit," Gov. Cooper said in a statement Thursday. </p>   <p>North Carolina Emergency Management director Will Ray said the department is prepared to provide needed resources.</p>
