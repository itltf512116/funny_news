   <p>The  that Merkel cell carcinoma most often appears in older people, and the risk of developing it can be increased by long-term sun exposure or a weak immune system.</p>   <p>Buffett  after being hospitalized to address what he said were "some issues that needed immediate attention."</p>   <p>His family asked that, in lieu of flowers, donations could be make to Singing for Change — Buffett's foundation — as well as Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and the MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p>   <p>Born in Pascagoula, Miss., on Christmas Day in 1946, Buffett was also an author and business owner, with a constellation of brands to his name including Margaritaville restaurants and Land Shark beer.</p>
