   <p>The popular singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett  after living with Merkel cell skin cancer for four years, according to  on Sunday.</p>   <p>Buffett, 76, was well-known for his beach-themed soft rock music, with hits including "Margaritaville" and "It's Five O'Clock Somewhere."</p>   <p>"He continued to perform during treatment, playing his last show, a surprise appearance in Rhode Island, in early July," the post read.</p>   <p>Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare form of skin cancer that has a high risk of recurring and can metastasize within two to three years of being diagnosed, .</p>

   <p>The  that Merkel cell carcinoma most often appears in older people, and the risk of developing it can be increased by long-term sun exposure or a weak immune system.</p>   <p>Buffett  after being hospitalized to address what he said were "some issues that needed immediate attention."</p>   <p>His family asked that, in lieu of flowers, donations could be make to Singing for Change — Buffett's foundation — as well as Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and the MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p>   <p>Born in Pascagoula, Miss., on Christmas Day in 1946, Buffett was also an author and business owner, with a constellation of brands to his name including Margaritaville restaurants and Land Shark beer.</p>
