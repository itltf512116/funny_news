                A PEN America report found that the number of books permanently removed from U.S. school libraries and classrooms has quadrupled — to 1,263 books in the last school year from 333 the year before.

   <p>School book bans and restrictions in the U.S. rose 33% in the last school year, according to a from the free speech group PEN America, continuing what it calls a worrisome effort aimed at the "suppression of stories and ideas." Florida had more bans than any other state.</p>   <p>Overall, PEN America said it found 3,362 cases of book bans, up from 2,532 bans in the 2021-'22 school year.</p>   <p>The organization counts any move that restricts access to a book as a ban, including books removed from classrooms or libraries or both, as well as books  temporarily removed while they're being challenged.  </p>

   <p>"We keep wondering if we've reached the peak yet," Meehan says. "And all signals suggest that there's still growing momentum, and it really is against kind of public opinion."   </p>   <p>Recent  found that 64% of Americans oppose book bans by school boards, and 69% oppose book bans by state lawmakers. But PEN says book banning efforts are being "supercharged" by local and national coordinated pressure campaigns and by punitive state laws, which are having a chilling effect on teachers and librarians.  </p>   <p>Just under half the books involved deal with violence or physical abuse, including sexual assault; a little less than a third focus on LGBTQ+ identities; and nearly a third include characters of color and themes of race or racism. </p>   <p>The restrictions came disproportionately from Florida, which accounts for more than 40% of book bans in the last school year, or 1,406 instances. Texas was next with 625, followed by Missouri, Utah and Pennsylvania. </p>

   <p>Those pushing book restrictions say they're happening more often because there is a growing number of inappropriate books in schools. </p>   <p>"Of course, it's going to explode," says Michelle Beavers, a member of a local Moms for Liberty chapter in Florida. "Once you show people what's in their kids' schools, their mouths drop ... and they feel compelled to do something."  </p>
