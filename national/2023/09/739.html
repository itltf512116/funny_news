   <p></p>   <p>Candidates vying for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination will debate for the second time Wednesday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in Simi Valley, Calif. Former President Donald Trump, who currently has a sizable lead in the crowded field of GOP candidates, will once again not be on stage at the debate.</p>   <p>Instead, Trump is expected to  on Wednesday where he will speak at an auto parts manufacturing plant. That plant, owned by Drake Enterprises, is a non-union shop, according to the AFL-CIO. Other sources familiar with the situation say it is not affiliated with the UAW or the ongoing strikes. </p>

   <p>Seven candidates have qualified to take part in Wednesday's debate: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">What the candidates might talk about tonight</h3>   <p>It's hard to imagine that Donald Trump won't be a major topic of conversation this time around. With the clear exception of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, most Republican presidential candidates have tried to avoid directly critiquing the former president. However, Trump is facing a new round of  this week. On Tuesday, a judge in New York ruled that Trump committed fraud by inflating the value of his assets. </p>   <p>Some candidates might be feeling more pressure to comment on what will happen if Trump becomes the nominee amid his growing legal issues. </p>   <p>Like the last debate, abortion will also probably take center stage, again. This is an important issue for the base of the party – but it's also a point of contention among the GOP. </p>   <p>Trump has not said whether he would support a federal ban on the procedure, if elected. However, he did  Gov. Ron DeSantis for signing a six-week ban in Florida and called it a "terrible mistake."</p>    and will be hosted by Fox Business Network, alongside the Spanish language TV news outlet Univision, and Rumble – an online video platform mostly used by conservatives. </p>
