   <p>The report said the people removed were seen vaping and using a cell phone to record the performance, against theater rules. </p>   <p>Theater staff received three different complaints<strong> </strong>about the behavior, prompting security to issue a warning to the two patrons during intermission. But five minutes into the second act, the staff received a fourth complaint, and mobilized to remove the two patrons.</p>   <p>One of the ushers reported that the guests resisted leaving. </p>   <p>"They told me they would not leave. I told them that they need to leave the theater and if they do not, they will be trespassing. The patrons said they would not leave. I told them I would (be) going to get Denver Police. They said go get them," the usher in the report. </p>

   <p>Surveillance footage shared with local news outlets appears to show Boebert, seated next to a man in a suit jacket in row E, towards the front of the 2,800-person theater. </p>   <p>As the audience applauds a scene's end, the pair are confronted by two security guards as surrounding patrons watch on. After a minute of conversation, they get up to leave. </p>

   <p>Boebert turns back several times to speak to security guards as she's escorted through the theater's lobby. According to the incident report, the pair were saying things like "Do you know who I am?," "I am on the board" and "I will be contacting the mayor."</p>   <p>At one point Boebert stops to take a photo of herself, surveillance footage shows. Once outside the theater, she walks hand-in-hand with the man and twirls, as if dancing.</p>   <p>In a statement to NPR, Boebert's campaign manager dismissed the report as over-blown. </p>
