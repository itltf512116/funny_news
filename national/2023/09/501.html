But five minutes into the second act, the staff received a fourth complaint, and mobilized to remove the two patrons.</p>   <p>One of the ushers reported that the guests resisted leaving. </p>   <p>"They told me they would not leave. I told them that they need to leave the theater and if they do not, they will be trespassing. The patrons said they would not leave. I told them I would (be) going to get Denver Police. They said go get them," the usher in the report. </p>

After a minute of conversation, they get up to leave. </p>

Once outside the theater, she walks hand-in-hand with the man and twirls, as if dancing.</p>   <p>In a statement to NPR, Boebert's campaign manager dismissed the report as over-blown. </p>
