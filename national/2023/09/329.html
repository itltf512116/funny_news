   <p>MILWAUKEE - Jennifer Nuno voted for President Biden because she thought he'd bring more decency back to the White House.<br/><br/>It hasn't turned out the way the Latino mother of two hoped.<br/><br/>Speaking over the TVs turned to a Spanish-language telenovela, Nuno volunteered why she was unhappy with the president as her 11-year-old got a back-to-school haircut.</p>   <p>The 30-year-old esthetician sits on a set of benches alongside other parents at this hair salon in Lincoln Village, a Milwaukee neighborhood where it's about as common to be greeted in Spanish as it is in English. </p>   <p>She appreciates Biden's work on student loans but says she questions what practical differences he's made here - for the larger Latino community in Milwaukee.</p>

   <p>Wisconsin is not known for the power of its Latino vote, but in a state with such tiny margins even a small shift can have a big impact on national politics.</p>   <p>Most Latinos are not "committed Democratic ideologues," explained Ben Marquez, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. </p>   <p>"Republicans don't need to win the Latino vote," said Marquez, who specializes in Latino studies. "They just need to take a big chunk out of the traditional Democratic vote."</p>   <p>He notes there are more than 180,000 unregistered, eligible Latino voters in the state. </p>   <p>Biden won Wisconsin by less than 25,000 votes in 2020. Trump won the state in 2016 by roughly the same number of votes. </p>

   <p>In Milwaukee's most heavily Latino populated wards, Latino support for Biden slipped some 6 to 10 points, according to pollster Charles Franklin from Marquette University Law School. </p>   <p>"So, in that sense, Milwaukee's Hispanic majority wards shifted. And they shifted in much the same way that we saw in parts of Florida and Texas," Franklin said.</p>   <p>The state Republican Party is just weeks away from opening up a new Hispanic Community Center in Milwaukee's south side. </p>

   <p>Hilario Deleon, chairman of the Milwaukee County Republican party, has been walking the streets of Lincoln Village and other minority neighborhoods with a message that conservatives have more to offer on issues that are important to the community. He specifically mentions jobs and high food prices.  </p>   <p>"Recent trends show that more and more Hispanics and Latinos are becoming conservative," said Deleon, who has Latino roots himself. </p>   <h3 class="edTag">Democrats confident, but cautious, on Latino voters</h3>   <p>Democrats and Latino activists are still confident that they will win on policy.</p>   <p>Voces de la Frontera Action has been conducting extensive outreach, registering new voters and increasing participation across the city and state.</p>

   <p>Mario Juarez is a 24-year-old college student. He's also Latino and gay but says he shouldn't be put in any specific voting bloc. </p>   <p>He runs a landscape architecture company. As a small business owner, he's more concerned about jobs and the economy. </p>   <p>He also worries about what he calls Biden's 'woke' agenda and the administration's efforts to elevate a gender ideology.</p>   <p>"I used to be very liberal," he said. "But I think I have recently I've kind of opened my mind a lot more and I've really looked into my core values and who I am as a person."</p>   <p>Juarez says he's feeling his core values, right now, align more with the Republican Party.</p>   <p>And back at the hair salon, Nuno says she's just waiting for one of the candidates - Republican or Democrat - to offer up more practical solutions for the community. </p>   <aside id="ad-third-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>She hasn't heard any yet. </p>   <p>"If Republicans have some good points, I'm open to voting for them," she said. "But it really, really has to persuade me to choose them."</p>
