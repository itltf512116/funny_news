"This isn't a simple solution, but it is a possible one should you need or want to make the trek."</p>   <p>Music producer Diplo said he and comedian Chris Rock escaped the event on Saturday after walking 6 miles before hitching a ride from a fan in a pickup truck.</p>   <p>"I legit walked the side of the road for hours with my thumb out cuz I have a show in dc tonight and didnt want to let yall down," .</p>    after his first trip to the festival ended with "an incredibly harrowing 6 mile hike at midnight through heavy and slippery mud."</p>   <p>President Biden has been briefed on the situation, according to a White House official, and the administration is monitoring the event. Event attendees should listen to state and local officials, and event organizers, the administration official said.</p>

"It is because of this that we are all well-prepared for a weather event like this."</p>   <p>"We have done table-top drills for events like this. We are engaged full-time on all aspects of safety and looking ahead to our Exodus as our next priority."</p>   <p>Organizers said they would send mobile cell trailers and open up the internet to multiple areas throughout the desert playa, as well as try to help transport buses out of the area. "Get some rest and spend some quality time with your campmates," the festival said in the Saturday night statement. "We will all get out of this, it will just take time."</p>   <p>Attendee Bobby White, who hosts the TV series , squelched through the mud against a backdrop of gunmetal skies and soggy tents in a YouTube video posted Saturday.</p>

   <p>"Every time you step, you pick up more mud and it's just really hard to move," White said. "There is absolutely no way you could move a vehicle through this right now."</p>   <p>With the gates closed, service vehicles on Saturday weren't able to reach the port-a-potties in a timely manner to empty the waste, causing toilets to overflow, attendee Kris Edwards said . Video posted to social media on Sunday afternoon showed people cheering for the eventual arrival of a sanitation service vehicle.</p>   <p>Still, event volunteer Josh Lease said spirits on the ground remain high. In true Burning Man spirit, he said people are helping each other out — sharing warm clothes and phone chargers where they can — and music is blaring.</p>   <p>"It's like any other Burning Man, just muddy," he told NPR on Saturday evening.</p>   <p>The weather has forced the postponement of some art installation burns, including the burning of the namesake wooden-man effigy, a ritual that traditionally happens on Saturday night.<strong> </strong>That burn is now scheduled to take place at 9:30 p.m. on Sunday night, weather permitting, event officials said.</p>    it's working with the Bureau of Land Management, a federal body that patrols and permits the event, and the Pershing County Sheriff's Office to stay updated on the situation and offer support as needed.</p>
