   <p>The rare baby giraffe that was born without any spots and has taken the world by storm now has a name: Kipekee.</p>   <p>The moniker, which means "unique" in Swahili, was revealed Tuesday morning on the show.</p>   <p>David Bright, director of the  in Limestone, Tenn., said nearly 40,000 people from around the world voted to name the 5-week-old calf, believed to be the only one of its kind on the planet.</p>   
            
                           
                        <h3 class="slug"></h3>

   <p>The public had four options to choose from, including Firyali, meaning unusual or extraordinary; Shakiri, which translates to she is most beautiful; and Jamella, signifying one of great beauty.</p>   <p>Bright said, Kipekee won by approximately 6,000 votes.</p>   <p>"A lot of guests said it was the easiest name for a child to say," he told viewers.</p>   <p>Bright had  told WJHL that the zoo looked at thousands of names and their meanings before settling on the four choices.</p>   <p>"Those four are the four the family are all really attached to," Bright said.</p>   <aside id="ad-backstage-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>So far, he said, the spotless superstar is "very laid back, still curious about everything, checking everything out every day."</p>   <p>According to the zoo, giraffe experts believe Kipekee is the only solid-color reticulated giraffe living anywhere in the world. Reticulated giraffes are a subspecies of giraffes native to the horn of Africa.</p>   <p>Standing 14 to 15 feet tall, the creatures are the tallest land mammals in the world. When mothers give birth, the calves are already 6 feet tall, and apart from especially rare occasions, they're born covered from hoof to horn in brown spots.</p>
