				<p>In an interview, Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard confirmed that he made a trade request but wisely chose not to elaborate on that further.</p>
<p>The seven-time All-Star, however, made it clear that while he&nbsp;, his heart and all the things he has started for Portland remain and that he intends to finish it.</p>
<p>"I can say that there was [a trade request] and I would just prefer not to speak on the Trail Blazers," the 33-year-old cager stated.</p>
<p>Lillard gave his take during an exclusive interview by Andscape at Formula Zero Elite Camp last August 18.</p>
<p>It was understandable that the 2013 NBA Rookie of the Year was being careful about what he would say to anyone regarding the Blazers and the celebrated trade request.</p>

<p>Besides, the league had already sent out a&nbsp;&nbsp;regarding the Lillard case,&nbsp;<em>ESPN</em>&nbsp;reported.</p>
<p>Should Lillard or his agent, Aaron Goodwin, make any future comments that came close to suggesting that the All-Star guard would not fully perform the services called for under his contract in the event of a trade, the 6th overall pick of the 2012 NBA Draft would be subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p>One can only refer to the case of James Harden of the Philadelphia 76ers, who drew a hefty $100,000 fine for his comments while he was in China. That, however, is&nbsp;&nbsp;by the National Basketball Players Association.</p>
<h2>Dame will finish what he started</h2>
<p>Although he appears to be leaving the Trail Blazers, Lillard clarified that his love for Portland remains.</p>
<p>"Every initiative that I've started, I'll continue and I'll finish regardless of anything. The love will be that because the way I've said I feel about Portland is how I feel about Portland. I say what I mean and I mean what I say. It's been fine. It's been what it's always been ..." Lillard said.</p>
