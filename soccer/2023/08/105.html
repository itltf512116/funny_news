					(Photo : Christof Koepsel/Getty Images) BREMEN, GERMANY - Harry Kane of Bayern Munich runs off the ball during the Bundesliga match between SV Werder Bremen and FC Bayern München at Wohninvest Weserstadion on August 18, 2023 in Bremen, Germany.
				<p>England striker Harry Kane&nbsp;&nbsp;for the upcoming 2023-24 season.</p>
<p>Following a $110 million&nbsp;&nbsp;German club Bayern Munich, plus $21 million in add-ons, the 30-year-old will wear a different jersey for the first time in years, ditching his Tottenham Hotspur kit for Bayern's red shirts.</p>
<p>Aside from wearing a new shirt, the Premier League's second-all-time topscorer will wear a new brand of boots, perhaps for the rest of his playing career.</p>
<p>Multiple reports say Kane&nbsp;&nbsp;to a lifetime boot deal with American shoe company Skechers that is set to make its foray into the sport. Figures and details of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>"New boots. New club. New season. Let's go," Kane&nbsp;&nbsp;social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, while showing off his new Skechers boots.</p>
<p>Kane is the company's first endorser signing for its football division, and he will be the face of the brand's first football boot, the SKX_01.</p>
<p>The shoe Kane previewed featured a primarily blue color fading lightly up to the toe. It has the signature Skechers "S" logo on the side, a usual sight in most of the company's shoes, this time in neon green. The boot is set to launch in the United Kingdom and Europe this coming September.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new partnership, the former Tottenham Hotspur said that it is a time of transition in his career, and the England striker is thrilled to announce his signing with Skechers at the same time as making a big move in his football career by joining Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>The 2020-21 Premier League Playmaker of the Season also said that ever since meeting Skechers, the design team, and seeing the boots for the first time, he felt confident that Skechers was onto something special.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I've been wearing the boots for weeks, scoring in them in preseason. They're unlike anything I've experienced before," the three-time Premier League Golden Boot winner said.</p>

<h2>Nike held off giving Harry Kane a new boot deal to prioritize Erling Haaland</h2>

<p>Nike&nbsp;&nbsp;giving Kane a new big-money deal after their contract expired in 2022, prioritizing Manchester City and Norway striker Erling Haaland, a shoe-free agent back then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The striker also had deals before with Apple-owned American sound equipment maker Beats by Dr. Dre, Chinese electronics company TCL, British soft drink brand Lucozade, and German menswear brand Hugo Boss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kane&nbsp;&nbsp;$27.3 million annually for the next four years in Bayern Munich as part of his contract, which is roughly $508,000 per week. He will be the squad's highest earner, surpassing goalkeeper and captain Manuel Neuer who earns $445,000 weekly.</p>
