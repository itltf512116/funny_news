   <p>The country, a little over 50 years old, marked a milestone on Monday after Emirati astronaut Sultan Alneyadi  to Earth in a SpaceX capsule following six months aboard the International Space Station. It marked the longest space mission by an Arab astronaut. He also became the first person from the Middle East to conduct a space walk outside the ISS.</p>

   <p>While he is not the first Arab astronaut to travel to space — that was Saudi Arabia's Prince Sultan bin Salman in the early 1990s — and is the second Emirati to do so, Alneyadi's time aboard the ISS highlights the Gulf state's regional edge in space exploration. Saudi Arabia is also revamping its space program in a bid to catch up with its smaller Gulf neighbor.</p>

   <p>The UAE has a population of about 10 million, with only about a million of them Emirati citizens and the rest foreign workers. It has limited political freedoms — often drawing criticism from human rights groups — and is led by hereditary rulers from each of its seven emirates. But the rulers have placed a priority on space exploration, spending  on various industry projects to spur investments, boost the country's profile and give it a competitive technological edge.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">Building a space program with help</h3>   <p>The Dubai-based , established in 2006 with just five engineers, has grown to about 250 engineers and scientists. Its  has been orbiting Mars since 2021, gathering new findings about the red planet's atmosphere.</p>
