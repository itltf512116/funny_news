   <p>Voyager 2 launched a little over two weeks before Voyager 1 in 1977. Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to study Uranus and Neptune. The spacecrafts are currently in interstellar space — beyond our solar system — and are the farthest human-made objects from Earth. Both Voyager 1 and 2 contain sounds and images selected to portray life on Earth in the event they ever encounter intelligent life in our universe. </p>   <h3 class="edTag">The sneaky swimmers hiding to catch their prey </h3>   <p>A from researchers in the U.K. showed the first evidence of a non-human predator — the trumpetfish — using another animal to hide from their prey. </p>   <p>To study the behavior, two researchers dove into colonies of trumpet fish prey and set up a system that looked like a laundry line. They moved 3D models of fish — either a predatory trumpet fish, a non-predatory parrotfish or both — across the line and observed the colony's reaction. They saw that when the trumpet fish model "swam" closely to the parrotfish, the prey colony reacted as though they only saw the parrotfish. </p>   .</p>   <p>The findings were published Monday in the journal </p>   <p></p>   <h3 class="edTag">Big waves along the California coast</h3>   <p>Some surfers describe them as the . </p>   <p>Climate researchers aren't as sure. As NPR climate correspondent  reported earlier this month, a new investigating nearly a century of data found increasing wave heights along the California coast as global temperatures warm. Researchers say this heightened ocean wave activity poses a threat to coastlines and may exacerbate the impacts of extreme waves for coastal communities. </p>
