   <p>Talk about a long-distance call.</p>   <p>NASA said it resumed full communications with the Voyager 2 on Friday after almost two weeks of silence from the interstellar spacecraft. </p>   <p>The agency's said a series of ground antennas, part of the Deep Space Network, registered a carrier signal from Voyager 2 on Tuesday. However, the signal was too faint.</p>   <p>A Deep Space Network facility in Australia then sent  to the Voyager 2 telling it to turn its antenna back toward Earth. The signal was sent more than 12.3 billion miles away and it took 37 hours to get a response from the spacecraft, NASA said. </p>

   <p>What might seem like a slight error had big consequences: NASA previously said it wouldn't be able to communicate with the craft until October, when the satellite would go through one of its routine repositioning steps. </p>   <p>"That is a long time to wait, so we'll try sending up commands several times" before October, program manager Suzanne Dodd </p>

   <p>Even if Voyager 2 had failed to reestablish communications until fall, the engineers expected it to stay moving on its planned trajectory on the edge of the solar system. </p>   <p>Voyager 2 entered interstellar space in November 2018 — more than 40 years since it launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla. To this day, Voyager 2 remains one of only two human-made objects to ever operate outside the heliosphere, which  as "the protective bubble of particles and magnetic fields generated by the Sun." </p>   <p>Its primary mission was to study the outer solar system, and already, Voyager 2 has proved its . Equipped with several imaging instruments, the spacecraft is credited with documenting the discovery of 16 new moons, six new rings and Neptune's "Great Dark Spot." </p>

   <p>Voyager 2 is also carrying some precious cargo, like a message in a bottle, should it find itself as the subject of another world's discovery: containing a variety of natural sounds, greetings in 55 languages and a 90-minute selection of music. </p>   <p>Last month's command mix-up foreshadows the craft's inevitable end </p>   <p>"Eventually, there will not be enough electricity to power even one instrument," reads . "Then, Voyager 2 will silently continue its eternal journey among the stars." </p>   <aside id="ad-secondary-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>Meanwhile, Voyager 2's sister spacecraft, Voyager 1, is still broadcasting and transmitting data just fine from a slightly farther vantage point of 15 billion miles away. </p>


      <h5 class="hdr">Correction Aug. 3, 2023</h5>
   <p><p>A previous version of this article implied that Voyager 2 flew past Uranus in 2018 when, in fact, the spacecraft concluded its encounter with the planet and started heading toward Neptune in 1986. Voyager 2 entered interstellar space in November 2018.</p></p>
