                Members of the Chumash tribe have pushed for a decade to create a new marine sanctuary. If created, it would be the first to be designated with tribal involvement from the outset.

   <p>The Biden administration is one step away from designating the first national marine sanctuary nominated by a tribe. The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary would protect 5,600 square miles of ocean off the central California coast, an area known for its kelp forests, sea otters and migratory whales. Tribal members of the Chumash, , would be involved in managing it. </p>   <p>The decision is part of the Biden administration's push to give Native American tribes a say over lands and waters that were forcibly taken from them. Under the proposal, the area would be protected from energy development.</p>    in Washington state. </p>   <p>Only one band of Chumash, the Santa Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians, is federally recognized. Other bands, like many tribes in California, are not. In the mid-1800s, Congress — a move that was kept secret for decades. Other bands of Chumash would be able to join the sanctuary's advisory council, which also provides feedback for decisions and priorities.</p>   <p>The new boundary of the sanctuary is smaller than the originally proposed 7,600 square miles. It now would exclude an area that is likely to be used for undersea transmission cables from future wind turbines. California's coast has been the focus of new attention in recent years, as the wind industry looks for places to . The state has an ambitious goal to get 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2045. </p>    to start a monitoring program where the new sanctuary would be designated. </p>
