   <p>This summer, with wildfire smoke suffocating swaths of North America, we've been warned to stay indoors to avoid poor-quality air. But there are things  your home you don't necessarily want to be inhaling either. </p>   <p>Once you start learning about possible indoor air pollutants, it may be difficult to stop noticing them, warns , national senior director for policy at the American Lung Association.</p>   <p>One source is moisture stemming from flooding, leaks, or even just high humidity, which can "support the proliferation of germs, pathogens, mold, dust mites, allergens or actual toxins," says Pruitt.</p>    that can release  like formaldehyde, benzene and other volatile organic compounds. These can be found in furnishings like wall covers, furniture and carpets. </p>

   <p>And, of course, smoking or burning a fire indoors introduces smoke. Plus, sometimes outdoor air wafting in through your windows can contain troublesome contaminants, like wildfire smoke, pollen and other allergens. </p>   <h3 class="edTag">Health impacts from indoor air</h3>   <p>Poor indoor air quality can have health consequences that range from irritation of the eyes, nose and throat to headaches and dizziness to asthma attacks. It's also linked to respiratory and heart disease, according to the . </p>   <p>There may be cognitive risks to breathing polluted air as well. For example, one  showed that workers didn't perform as well on cognitive tests when office ventilation rates were lower.</p>

   <p>And finally, with COVID-19 and other viruses circulating, the spread of airborne germs is a serious issue indoors. </p>   , a surgeon and researcher from the University of Michigan with a background in architecture. "So circulating air reduces the likelihood of it transmitting between people."</p>   <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its  this May, urging building owners and operators to adopt practices that reduce the spread of viral particles. Though these recommendations are perhaps most relevant to schools, hospitals, and group residential or care facilities, homeowners could learn from their advice too.</p>   <p>It's a lot to keep track of. </p>   <p>"Actually, working on indoor air quality makes you kind of crazy!" exclaims Pruitt. </p>   <p>But don't panic. We've got tips.</p>

   <h3 class="edTag">Maximize fresh air</h3>   <p>Pruitt offers three basic steps you can take to make your air better at home. The first has to do with ventilation. "In general, in most situations," she says, "fresh air from outside is better than no fresh air from outside."</p>   <p>This means that opening up your windows is often the simplest way to disperse anything nefarious that may be accumulating inside. If you have it, running your central air can be a good way to bring in outside air.</p>   <p>The  using a fan to improve indoor air quality. For instance, you might place one near an open window to help exhaust indoor air to the outdoors. </p>   <p>However, says Pruitt, "there are some times when the air outside is not a good idea to be bringing into your home." Just take the terrible air billowing off the wildfires in Canada this summer.</p>   <p>So check your local air quality index before cracking your windows, to be safe.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">Control the source of the pollutants</h3>   <p>The second thing you can do is called source control, which is "keeping sources of contaminants out of the indoor environment if you can," says Pruitt, including pests, mold and pollen.</p>

   <p>Cleaning your home is helpful, but Pruitt warns that the "use of harsh cleaning supplies can introduce its own risks." She advises that you read the labels and select safer products when you can. "EPA has a  designation that is a helpful guide," she says.</p>   <p>Then there's gas stoves and appliances, which can leak methane and carbon dioxide, says , a lecturer at the Harvard Business School and author of . "So unless you have perfect exhaust of what you're burning, then you're going to have particulates and compounds in the house."</p>   <p>If you're not able to jettison your gas lines, make sure you've got a working carbon monoxide detector. And if you have an exhaust fan, double check that it's venting to the outside.</p>   <p>"It's kind of strange," says Macomber, "that people evolved over centuries to have open flames where they live."</p>   <p>Instead of always cooking with the gas stove, consider using the microwave, toaster oven, or a portable induction cooktop when possible. Pruitt stresses the importance of making sure your appliances are serviced regularly so that they're in good working order.</p>   <h3 class="edTag">Purify the air</h3>   <p>Finally, if necessary, the third thing you can try to improve your air is filtration. For instance, if you want to remove airborne particles like smoke, dust, pollen, mold spores and germs, it may make sense to use an indoor air purifier. The CDC suggests using one with a , filter to reduce the spread of viral particles. They're effective at capturing other pollutants too. </p>   ."</p>   <p>And "for homes with air conditioners," says Ibrahim, "you have a filter that you're supposed to be changing regularly." He suggests swapping the default filter out for a better one. Filters come with MERV ratings, which stands for the minimum efficiency reporting values. A decent level is MERV 13, says Ibrahim. (HEPA filters are superior with a rating of at least MERV 17.)</p>   <p>Pruitt says that everyone, especially those most vulnerable to indoor pollutants like small children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions, benefits from these improvements. "Every small change you are ready and able to make will improve your indoor air quality," she says.</p>   <p>But what if you're prepared to invest more in improving the air in your home environment?</p>   <h3 class="edTag">What to know if you're considering HVAC upgrades</h3>   <p>If you're in a position to upgrade your home's HVAC system, there's a lot you can do to improve your air quality. </p>   <p>Macomber, who ran a construction company out of Boston for 30 years, is remodeling his home in Cambridge, Mass., focusing on energy efficiency and air quality. He has a few suggestions.</p>

   <p>There are no national requirements for buildings or homes to follow the new CDC guidelines. But gradually, cities and communities in different parts of the country are developing their own rules and regulations. For instance, the state of Massachusetts has introduced what it's calling a "" that municipalities can opt into to make commercial and residential construction projects more energy efficient.</p>   <p>These enhancements can also improve air quality, which can be especially important for more vulnerable populations, including senior citizens like 87-year-old Marvin Wilkenfeld.</p>   <p>In 2004, he moved into a set of government-subsidized apartments for low-income seniors in Newton, Mass., just west of Boston run by the nonprofit .</p>   <p>He liked the place a lot, including the community that surrounded him and the convenience store he volunteered to run out of the ground floor of his building.</p>   <p>But Wilkenfeld has a dust and pollen allergy. "I get very stuffy and I'm very congested. I'm sneezing and, of course, I'm constantly blowing my nose," he says, chuckling.</p>   
        


    
        
            <p>
                All the units in the building where Marvin Wilkenfeld lives in Newton, Mass., are receiving a major upgrade, which includes air quality enhancements.

   <p>Now, even with the windows shut, every unit gets a steady supply of outside air through what's called an energy recovery ventilator. It's a system of air flow that trades inside air for outside air. It also passes heat between the air streams so that the incoming air is a more comfortable temperature.</p>   <p>"It's taking air from in here," says O'Toole, gesturing toward the bathroom and the kitchen, and it pushes it outside, along with any indoor air pollutants like smoke, grease and sprays. "And at the same time, it's bringing the same volume of outside air back into the unit."</p>   <p>In this way, the residents get fresh, filtered air all the time. Another big change is the heating and cooling setup. The new system is called variable refrigerant flow, which provides heating or cooling throughout the year based on demand, along with air filtration.</p>   <p>Wilkenfeld says the changes are marvelous. "I'm looking forward to moving in and knowing that my indoor environment is being cleansed and it's comfortable," he says.</p>
