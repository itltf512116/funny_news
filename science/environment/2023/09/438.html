                Construction continues on the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016. Federal officials on Friday released a draft environmental review of oil pipeline without a recommendation from five options for the future of the line's controversial river crossing in North Dakota.

   <p>BISMARCK, N.D. — Federal officials on Friday released a draft environmental review of the , but said they're waiting for more input before deciding the future of the line's controversial river crossing in North Dakota.</p>   <p>The draft was released over three years after a federal judge and revoked the permit for the Missouri River crossing, upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe is concerned a pipeline oil spill could contaminate its water supply.</p>   <p>The environmental review is key for whether the federal government reissues the permit. The pipeline has been operating , including during the environmental review.</p>            
                        <h3 class="slug"></h3>

   <p>A fifth option is a 111-mile reroute of the pipeline to north of Bismarck, over 38 miles upstream from the current crossing. The reroute would require new permits from federal, state and local authorities and regulators, which could take at least two years. The exact path of such a reroute is unknown, according to the draft.</p>   <p>"We are seeking public input on the environmental analysis of each alternative, and that input combined with the environmental analysis will help us to make an informed decision among the alternatives," Corps Omaha District spokesman Steve Wolf told The Associated Press.</p>   <p>A comment period will end Nov. 13. Public meetings are scheduled Nov. 1-2 in Bismarck.</p>   
            
                           
                        <h3 class="slug"></h3>

   <p>A final environmental impact statement will follow the public input and environmental analysis, and a formal decision will be made, Wolf said.</p>   <p>North Dakota's governor-led, three-member Industrial Commission on Thursday heard of the draft's pending release. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum on Thursday called the selection of no preferred alternative "unusual if not unprecedented."</p>   <p>The pipeline, which officials say is safe, moves oil from western North Dakota to Illinois. Leaders in North Dakota's oil industry and state government consider the pipeline to be crucial infrastructure, with far less oil now transported by rail.</p>

   <p>Standing Rock last year withdrew as a cooperating agency in the environmental review.</p>   <p>The pipeline "is an ongoing trespass against the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe," Tribal Chair Janet Alkire previously said. "Every day that the pipeline operates and transfers oil, trespass damages continually accrue."</p>
