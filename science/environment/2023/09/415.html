   <p>Ocean temperatures have been extremely hot this summer, wreaking havoc on some of the world's highly vulnerable coral reefs. With marine heat waves only expected to get worse as the climate changes, scientists are increasingly focusing on an emergency plan: collecting coral specimens and safeguarding them onshore.</p>   <p>A library of corals, brought in from the wild, could be an insurance policy in the face of climate change, providing the genetic material to restore the reefs of the future. For long-term storage, some corals could end up in the deep freezer. </p>   <p>Scientists are working on preserving corals by cryogenically freezing them. In a new study, a team from the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, UC Berkeley and the University of Hawaii at Manoa report they  after freezing it at -196 degrees Celsius. </p>

   <p>"We have to gut through this," says Mary Hagedorn, senior scientist at Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute and the University of Hawaii at Manoa. "We have to do whatever is necessary to maintain the ecosystems on our planet." </p>   <h3 class="edTag">Deep freezing coral</h3>   <p>As a cryo-preservationist, Hagedorn gets questions that border science fiction, where humans seek to preserve themselves for centuries.</p>   <p>"They think of head freezers," she says, laughing. "They think of all this weird stuff."</p>   <p>Instead, her work is much closer to human fertility treatments, where eggs and sperm are frozen to use later. Marine scientists have used the technique on coral sperm and young coral larvae, but freezing a living animal is much more complex.</p>   </h3>

   <p>With coral fragments from Hawaii, Hagedorn and her colleagues froze them at extremely cold temperatures in special chambers that prevent damaging ice crystals from forming. They were then able to thaw them and show the corals were still alive. </p>   <p>Making the corals healthy again after thawing is the next challenge, especially given that corals have roommates. Photosynthetic algae live in their tissue, creating food for the coral. But when stressed, the corals lose their algae, turning them white. Hagedorn says goring forward, restoring the algae will be key to reviving coral that can reproduce again. </p>   <h3 class="edTag">Genetic library of coral</h3>   <p>As marine heat waves become more common and intense, a global effort is underway to preserve the genetic diversity of corals. The  is seeking to collect specimens from all over the world. Hagedorn says cryopreservation could be a vital strategy for building a library of corals, which hopefully one day could repopulate reefs.</p>   <p>"Noah's ark only brought two," she says. "We're doing way more than that."</p>   <p>Reefs can recover from a bleaching event, but repeated marine heat waves make it less likely for corals to survive or reproduce successfully. The oceans are also acidifying as they absorb carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, which can harm corals and make it difficult for them to build their skeletons. </p>   <aside id="ad-third-wrap" aria-label="advertisement">

   <p>"Corals will continue to die and unless we are replacing them with restoration, there won't be corals available in the future, even if we were to fix all of the threats," says Jennifer Moore, coral recovery coordinator with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. </p>   <p>As temperatures peaked on Florida's reefs this summer, Moore says some corals died outright from the heat. Research teams raced to preserve specimens from key coral species, collecting 150 elkhorn coral and 300 staghorn coral samples.</p>   <p>"That's less than one percent of their previous population," she says. "So we're already in a diminished state of genetic diversity. We can't afford to lose anything that we have."</p>   <p>Having those specimens could help breed the reefs of the future, since it's unknown what combination of genes could make corals more resistant to the threats they may face, be it heat or disease. </p>   <p>Moore says cryopreservation could be a key piece of the puzzle in bringing reefs back. But the success of restoration depends on curbing the emissions from burning fossil fuels.</p>   <p>"It is not a foregone conclusion," Moore says. "There are still things that can be done to combat climate change so that we are not forced to be on a trajectory to a place where there are no more coral reefs."  </p>
