		The U.S. once built a nuclear ship ... for passengers | Funny News - Scevala
	</title>
	<meta name="description" content='In the Port of Baltimore, a ship is docked that hasn&#039;t transported passengers for more than 50 years. It&#039;s the NS Savannah and it&#039;s designated a National Historic Landmark. That&#039;s because it was the first—and only—nuclear-powered passenger ship to have ever been built. Science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel tells us about his recent tour of the ship and why it was a symbol of peace in it&#039;s time.

   <p>In the Port of Baltimore, a ship is docked that hasn't transported passengers for more than 50 years. And although it stopped only after a few years, largely due to a lack of money, it successful in part. </p>   <p>That's because the ship, the NS , was the first and only nuclear-powered passenger ship. And it was meant to show that nuclear power could be used for peaceful purposes. Science correspondent  took a tour of the ship and talks to host  about why it was built, how it worked and why it was the only one of its kind.</p>   . </p>   <p> </p>   <p></p>   <p></p>
