   <p>Electric air taxis got one step closer to liftoff this week, when federal regulators gave one company the green light to start flight testing its new production prototype.</p>   <p>California-based transportation company Joby Aviation  that the Federal Aviation Administration had granted its aircraft a "," which allows it to operate in U.S. airspace with certain restrictions.</p>   <p>The FAA confirmed in an email to NPR that it had issued the certificate "for research and development purposes" on June 21. It said it had also granted one to a similar vehicle made by another company, Archer, the week before.</p>

   <p>This is actually the third Joby aircraft to get this certification<strong>,</strong> the FAA confirmed. The company has been building and flying pre-production prototypes thousands of miles since 2017.</p>   <p>But this time around is significant, because it's the first of its factory-built vehicles to be approved for test flights. Until now, , the company could only demo a prototype made by hand — as opposed to the ones now coming off its production line.</p>

   <p>Joby aims to begin commercial passenger operations in the U.S. in 2025, pending FAA certification. It has  to deliver a "transformational, sustainable home-to-airport transportation service" for fliers, set to roll out first in New York and Los Angeles.</p>   <p>That means customers in those cities would be able to reserve a seat for air taxi trips to and from the airports when booking Delta flights, the companies say. </p>   <p>An  shows one such journey, from a heliport in downtown Manhattan to John F. Kennedy International Airport, completed in seven minutes (as opposed to 49 minutes by car). </p>   <p>Beyond airport trips, Joby advertises its air taxis as "an aerial rideshare service" that customers can book through an app, as an alternative to ground transportation — at least in some ways. </p>

   <p>But, he writes in an email, the industry faces challenges, from noise to  concerns. There's also the optics, he says: "Rich people flying above the rest of us normal folks."</p>   <p>Because this type of transportation will likely mainly be provided by private sector companies, there are concerns that it will exclude low-income people, says Petra Hurtado, the director of research and foresight at the .</p>   <p>"Unless there will be funding mechanisms to make this an affordable option to all, integrating it into existing transit systems, I don't think it will be accessible to all," she tells NPR over email, adding that local governments may not have a say in how they operate because the skies are regulated by the FAA.</p>   <p>Hurtado also points out that while air taxis are being billed as sustainable, that depends on how they're being used.</p>

   <p>"If it replaces the person who would be driving or taking a taxi, it might generate less [greenhouse gas] emissions for that one trip, but how many air taxis would we need to replace the majority of cars in one particular route?" she added. "I wouldn't want to see a sky crowded with air taxis."</p>   <p>In an ideal world, Hurtado says, air taxis would fill existing gaps in urban transportation systems rather than create new ones. She'd also like to see cities take a more proactive approach to transportation planning in general, and learn from past mistakes.</p>   <p>That would mean, for example, considering the negative impacts not only of where air taxis land and take off, but along their route as well.</p>   <p>"Too often in the past have transportation projects impacted marginalized communities and disadvantaged populations," she wrote,  as an example. "I hope these mistakes won't be repeated with this type of transportation system."</p>
